Texas on the verge of allowing 'open carry' of handguns | Dallas ...	2015-04-16	DALLAS MORNING NEWS	http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20150417-texas-on-the-verge-of-allowing-open-carry-of-handguns.ece	en	austin  texas is on the verge of its most dramatic overhaul of firearms regulations in two decades as the house voted friday to allow licensed gun owners to openly carry handguns under the contentious proposal  tentatively approved on a 9635 vote  texans with the appropriate license would be able to carry handguns openly in a shoulder or belt holster the senate passed such a bill last month after a final vote next week  and once minor differences between the two chambers versions are ironed out  the measure would just need the ok from governor greg abbott he has said he will sign any legislation that expands second amendment rights  supporters said they were upholding constitutional rights and allowing greater liberty for gun owners that was long overdue though texans can already openly carry long guns such as rifles the state has long banned the practice for handguns the bill would align texas with 44 other states that allow some open carry of handguns its time to go ahead and take this next step said representative larry phillips rsherman the bills primary author its time to join the ranks of states like massachusetts  and allow our citizens to have this right  all but a few democrats opposed the bill while all republicans who were on hand voted for it police opposition democrats cited opposition from most police leaders they raised concerns that guns could more easily fall into the wrong hands and that officers could be confused about who is dangerous in a violent situation putting lawful gun owners at risk they offered several proposals to limit open carry but their amendments were consistently rejected by the houses solid gop majority and they said the bill was unnecessary given the broad acceptance of the current concealed handgun licensing program representative sylvester turner dhouston summed up his opposition in one word really  open carry is one of the two major pieces of gun legislation republicans are pushing in the legislature this year the other is campus carry or allowing the concealed carry of handguns in most state university buildings fridays measure would exempt college buildings from opencarry requirements that early focus marks gop lawmakers outreach to the partys conservative base which plays an increasingly outsized role in primary elections open carry which would go into effect in 2016 would have implications for other state gun rules since the bill is tied to the concealed handgun licensing program those rules  on where guns can be taken for instance  would also apply to openly carried handguns around 841500 texans currently have a concealed handgun license thats about 5 percent of texans who are 21 or older  the age requirement to get such a license for texans who are not active or former members of the armed services democrats efforts to limit the bill ranged from an amendment that would make it easier for businesses to post no guns signs to one requiring open carriers to display their license one idea to allow big cities like dallas to opt out of open carry drew debate from several north texas members are your constituents screaming out for open carry  representative rafael anchia asked his fellow dallas democrat representative eric johnson no they are not said johnson who offered the amendment is there a groundswell in dallas  from the business community from law enforcement from community groups that theres a problem that will be solved by open carry  asked anchia who had planned to offer a similar amendment no johnson said but i also recognize that there may be districts around the state where there is this outcry  gop representative kenneth sheets countered that many constituents in his dallas district did want open carry he said lawmakers shouldnt be treating the residents of the city of dallas any different than the residents of arlington or cleburne or college station  fears unwarranted the optout provision  like all the amendments offered by democrats  was overwhelmingly rejected the wide margins reflected strong support among republicans whove touted open carry as a safety measure and said fears about it are unwarranted they noted that predictions of increased violence were common when the state adopted concealedcarry 20 years ago republicans even succeeded in adding a provision that would reduce the penalty for those who take a concealed handgun onto property where its not allowed some tea party republicans  backed by a vocal group of gun rights activists  wanted more though pushing for the open carrying of handguns without a license representative jonathan stickland rbedford tried repeatedly to force a vote on socalled constitutional carry  phillips said the fate of that effort had long been decided  in part because of the antics of some gun rights advocates who support it early in the legislatures session one democratic lawmaker felt threatened by a small group of open carry advocates and a video of their protest in his office prompted house members to rally to his support its also how those that support your amendment have treated members of this house their families and our staff phillips told stickland republicans at one point appeared likely to attach campus carry to the open carry bill that proposal has also already passed out of the senate and though it has also cleared a house committee the bills house author representative allen fletcher rtomball tried to accelerate the progress but as tension rose in the house chamber he pulled the amendment follow tom benning on twitter at tombenning at a glance how the open carry bill works texans with an active concealed handgun license would be able to openly carry a handgun in a shoulder or belt holster starting in 2016 to get such a license in texas you must pass a background check get four to six hours of classroom training pass written and physical tests and pay a 140 fee about 841500 texans currently have a concealed handgun license thats about 5 percent of texans who are 21 or older  the age requirement to get such a license for texans who are not active or former members of the armed services texas would be the 45th state to allow some form of open carry of handguns texas already allows open carry of long guns such as rifles open carry wouldnt be allowed in areas where concealed carry is currently barred those areas include schools bars sporting events and businesses that have posted no guns signs if lawmakers this year also approve campus carry which would allow concealed carry of handguns in most public university buildings open carry still wouldnt be allowed in those areas whats next after a final procedural vote in the house next week the house and senate will have to reconcile minor differences in their versions of the measure and send it to governor greg abbott who is expected to sign it

in happier times when 33 of the legislatures 181 lawmakers voted against the state budget in final votes taken over memorial day weekend the dissents did not go unnoticed oh no thirtytwo of the 33 were cast by republicans in the senate all four no votes were by republicans as i reported in this story in saturdays paper senate finance committee chairman tommy williams rthe woodlands flew into a rage and tried to have senator dan patrick rhouston stripped of his education panel chairmanship williams declined to comment friday other senators and eyewitnesses though described him as highly upset because hed tried to accommodate patrick on his priority spending requests and felt betrayed when the former radio talkshow host bolted from the senates gop leadership team leaders may have felt they were ohsoclose to recording an impressive 310 vote in favor of the twoyear 197 billion budget after all williams had lassoed the chambers 12 democrats he may have believed patrick provided cover for three gop colleagues also to oppose the budget they were sens brian birdwell of granbury donna campbell of new braunfels and ken paxton of mckinney the senate took its final budget votes a day before the house did so the senates gop defections may have complicated speaker joe straus job of reining in his troops more on that in a minute speaker joe straus rsan antonio gavels out the regular session last week the drama played out behind the scenes patrick though normally a big talker said relatively little about the budget as the regular session ended still his action spoke volumes patrick heads the legislatures tea party caucus his nay vote lent legitimacy to outside conservative groups criticizing the budget  the very groups williams was trying to write off as crackpots during the senates final budget debate williams immediately confronted the four gop defectors he then went to work on the senate floor polling on a plan to take away patricks chairmanship williams hasnt revealed the results of his poll lieutenant governor david dewhurst who names committee chairmen said through a spokesman friday that he did not instigate or encourage williams bid to spank patrick but dewhurst is running for a fourth fouryear term next year and patrick may join two other highprofile republicans in challenging him against that backdrop williams attempt to enforce party discipline was fraught with danger for dewhurst one senator reportedly warned williams be careful youre fixing to make a martyr of patrick  another a democrat noted that williams plan required a rules change so that the education and higher education committees could be merged this senator declined to help do someones political dirty work  other senators told dewhurst and williams that the education chairmanship is such a thankless job the real punishment would be to keep patrick in it for as long as possible representative harvey hilderbran rkerrville in the house 29 of the chambers

gops wedge issues to an almost quaint degree he puts his emphasis on parsimony and efficiency  but also on compromise and consensus so in 2009 his first session as speaker he was delighted that the budget passed the house initially 1490 when it returned from conference committee house members ratified it by a still eyepopping margin of 1422 in 2011 though there was heavy democratic opposition on its first trip to the floor the budget was approved 9849 the conference report eventually passed 9753 with five republicans among the dissenters this year straus would have loved to get the red lights back down into single digits but he faced as we noted here last fall a changed house because his partys caucus tilted markedly to the right even as the democrats posted a net gain of seven house seats earlier this week a straus spokesman declined comment when i asked if the speaker would discipline members who voted against the budget another house leadership insider told me theres been discussion about what to do with them but no decisions

Saturday special: Texas House votes for easier, wider access to guns	2013-05-03	DALLAS MORNING NEWS	http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20130504-saturday-special-texas-house-votes-for-easier-wider-access-to-guns.ece	en	austin  aptly starting at high noon saturday the house passed 13 bills to make guns easier and cheaper to carry in the state opening the way for concealed handguns on college campuses and in the hands of marshals at elementary schools in a sweeping push the republicandominated house also approved a proposal to nullify new federal gun control laws the law would prompt the texas attorney general to sue and pursue hefty fines against a police chief district attorney or any other public official who tried to enforce such laws in that firearms protection act lawmakers ignored constitutional questions to push back against national ruminations on expanded background checks and assaultrifle bans the bills approved saturday face stiff opposition and a difficult future in the senate but with a national debate raging on gun violence after the newtown shooting house conservatives aimed to show fealty to the maxim that in texas gun control means using two hands many of the bills supporters spoke of freedom and the rights of all americans representative steve toth rwoodlands said his bill to refuse enforcement of any new federal gun laws was needed to preserve this right that keeps all people free  lawmakers approved measures on voice votes several after little or no debate democrats raised procedural challenges but they managed to stop only one minor measure mostly they went along to avoid getting caught voting against extending gun rights the exception was toths bill democrats asserted that taxpayers shouldnt be forced to foot the legal bills to defend a law that is clearly unconstitutional they tried but failed to amend the bill so that private donors instead of taxpayers would pay the legal costs of defending the bill when it was inevitably challenged in court calling the law unenforceable representative chris turner darlington argued that under the constitution even unpopular laws passed in washington apply to not part of the country  all of the country  this bill is not about the second amendment this bill is about  a political statement that we dont like president obama that we dont like whats going on in washington and we can go back home and say we took it to the president turner said he said taxpayers shouldnt have to pay for someones political statement this just doesnt pass muster said representative poncho nevarez deagle pass you cant come up here and say this about second amendment rights this is about american rights  thats just not good enough  but on saturday it was enough and republicans mowed down opposition guns at colleges on the proposal to allow those licensed to carry concealed weapons on university campuses author representative allen fletcher rtomball gave colleges a way to opt out the default law would be that licensees who pass the course and criminal background checks can carry their guns into classrooms but school presidents could determine  after soliciting student faculty and staff input  whether to ban guns on campus even schools that elect to allow guns could still prohibit them at sporting events graduations speeches and other large gatherings the bill would also allow schools to create rules regarding whether and how guns should be stored in dormitories i did not file this bill for concealed handgun license holders so they could be heroes in mass shooting situations fletcher said those incidents are rare but gun owners should have a right to protect themselves against harm he said colleges and universities are not crimefree zones he said fletcher said his bill would remove the felony penalties for a licensee who carries a gun onto a campus where they are banned a violator could be expelled fired or otherwise disciplined but no longer charged with a criminal penalty he said senator john whitmire dhouston chairman of the criminal justice committee has said that campus carry is dead in the senate but fletcher said his bill could win over key senators because it allows each campus the flexibility to decide and doesnt force them to allow guns current law allows campuses to ok concealed weapons and texas am university approved such a policy in november the fletcher proposal would make public universities opt out of campus carry private universities could opt in school marshals the school marshal measure offered by freshman representative jason villalba rdallas began as a response to the newtown shooting it would allow school districts and charter schools to designate a teacher or staff member to become a school marshal the marshal generally could not carry a gun in the school but could keep it locked somewhere in the building under the protection of texas children act the marshal would have to undergo 80 hours of state police training every two years in light of recent events were seeking to craft a texas solution to protect texas children villalba said bridget sharphorn of the moms demand action for gun sense in america coalition said her group is disappointed but not surprised by the house votes we have been watching closely and anticipated that this would happen therefore did not spend much energy in the house sharphorn said but we are ready to focus on the senate and then there will be elections she

Updated: Texas House approves bill to allow open carry of handguns	2015-04-16	DALLAS MORNING NEWS	http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/2015/04/after-being-delayed-this-week-house-is-expected-to-vote-on-friday-on-open-carry-bill.html/	en	scott smith a supporter of open carry gun laws wears a pistol as he prepares for a rally at the capitol monday jan 26 2015 in austin texas ap photoeric gay 02122015xnews updated at 517 pm friday austin  a bill to fundamentally overhaul the states firearms regulations  by allowing the licensed open carry of handguns  has now cleared both chambers of the legislature under the contentious proposal  tentatively approved friday 9635 in the gopcontrolled house  texans with the appropriate license would be able to carry handguns openly in a shoulder or belt holster the senate passed such a bill last month pending final house approval  and then the ironing out of a couple differences between the two versions  the measure would just need the ok from governor greg abbot and hes already said he will sign any legislation that expands second amendment rights  the idea opposed by most democrats and police officials would align texas with 44 other states that allow some open carry of handguns though texans can already openly carry long guns such as rifles the state has long banned the practice for handguns supporters who said they were upholding constitutional rights said the measure was long overdue its time to go ahead and take this next step said representative larry phillips rsherman the bills primary author its time to joint the ranks of states like massachusetts  and allow our citizens to have this right  open carry is one of the two major pieces of gun legislation being pushed by republicans through the legislature this year the other is a socalled campus carry bill which would allow for the concealed carry of handguns in most state university buildings that early focus marks gop lawmakers outreach to the partys conservative base which plays an increasingly outsized role in primary elections open carry which would go into effect in 2016 would have implications for other state gun rules since the bill is tied to the concealed handgun licensing program those rules  on where guns can go for instance  would now also apply to openly carried handguns around 841500 texans currently have a concealed handgun license thats about 5 percent of texans who are 21 years or older  the age requirement to get such a license for texans who are not active or former members of the armed services democrats as they did in the senate pushed back hard on the open carry proposal they pointed to reservations from most law enforcement officials  a group that includes the likes of dallas county sheriff lupe valdez and they said the bill was unnecessary given the broad acceptance of the current concealed handgun licensing program representative sylvester turner dhouston summed his opposition in one word really  democrats also offered several amendments to weaken the bills impact those efforts ranged from one that would make it easier for businesses to post no guns signs to one requiring open carriers to display their license and one idea to allow big cities like dallas to opt out of open carry drew debate from several north texas members are your constituents screaming out for open carry  representative rafael anchia asked his fellow dallas democrat representative eric johnson no they are not said johnson who offered the amendment is there a groundswell in dallas  from the business community from law enforcement from community groups that theres a problem that will be solved by open carry  asked anchia who had planned to offer a similar amendment no johnson said but i also recognize that there may be districts around the state where there is this outcry  gop representative kenneth sheets countered that he did have constituents in his dallas district who want open carry he said lawmakers shouldnt be treating the residents of the city of dallas any different than the residents of arlington or cleburne or college station  the optout provision  like all the amendments offered by democrats  was tabled with ease those wide margins reflected strong support among republicans whove touted open carry as a safety measure and whove said fears about it are unwarranted and republicans even succeeded in adding a provision that would lower the penalty for those who take a concealed handgun onto property where its not allowed but gop leaders still had to sort out some divisions within their own party some tea party republicans  backed by a vocal group of gun rights activists  have pushed instead allow the open carry of handguns without a license and representative jonathan stickland rbedford tried repeatedly to force a vote on socalled constitutional carry  but phillips said the fate of that effort had long been decided  in part because of the antics of some gun rights advocates who support it its also how those that support your amendment have treated members of this house their families and our staff he told stickland there was also a fleeting moment when it looked like republicans might attach campus carry to the open carry bill that proposal  which wouldnt allow open carry on campus if both measures pass  has also already passed out of the senate and though it has also cleared a house committee the bills house author representative allen fletcher rtomball tried to accelerate the progress but as tension rose in the house chamber he decided to pull down his amendment we are going to move forward he said original post austin  the house appears poised to approve on friday the licensed open carry of handguns  barring any lastminute maneuvering by democrats to further delay a vote on the proposal under the contentious measure  which features more than 80 republican coauthors  texans with the appropriate license would be able to carry handguns openly in a shoulder or belt holster the senate passed an identical bill last month a vote on the bill had been expected on tuesday but house democrats raised a successful point of order over a technical glitch that gummed up the records of how people testified at a committee hearing on the bill that staved off a vote for a few days even with the strong support for the bill  which marks gop lawmakers outreach to the partys conservative base  debate is expected to be intense the idea which would align texas with 44 other states that allow some open carry of handguns is opposed by most democrats and police officials but some tea party republicans are also upset that the bill doesnt allow the unlicensed open carry of handguns texans can already openly carry long guns such as rifles  without a license the passage of licensed open carry would have broad implications for other state gun regulations thats because the bill is tied to the existing concealed handgun licensing program and thus any concealed handgun rules would have to be considered in light of open carry around 841500 texans currently have a concealed handgun license thats about 5 percent of texans who are 21 years or older  the age requirement to get such a license for texans who are not active or former members of the armed services if the bill passes out of the house it would appear to be a lock to become law governor greg abbott has already said he will sign whatever legislation that reaches my desk that expands second amendment rights in texas

Texas attorney general candidates hotly disagree on experience ...	2013-09-27	DALLAS MORNING NEWS	http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/state-politics/20130928-texas-ag-candidates-hotly-disagree-on-experience-needed-for-job.ece	en	austin  the republican candidates for attorney general on saturday had a sometimes prickly debate where they agreed on most issues but differed sharply on who is best qualified to be the states top lawyer the forum part of a weekend public policy and politics convention sponsored by the texas tribune was the first major debate between representative dan branch of dallas senator ken paxton of mckinney and railroad commission chairman barry smitherman of houston the candidates appeared together earlier this month in east texas during moments of the hourlong debate the candidates had minor clashes particularly branch and smitherman smitherman who in recent weeks has made awkward statements about marriage gay rights and the need to prepare texas to become an island nation had to explain his positions to the hundreds in attendance after the debate smitherman and branch had a heated exchange as they left the stage smitherman had earlier questioned whether a couple of tea party leaders had actually endorsed branch after they were facetoface as audience members filed out of the room branch told smitherman dont lie  specifically smitherman said that allen fletcher rtomball was not supporting branch but when contacted saturday fletcher chairman of the house tea party caucus said that he had indeed endorsed branch i dont know why barry would say that fletcher said i told him i had endorsed branch  the major differences between the candidates involved their qualifications to succeed attorney general greg abbott now a gubernatorial candidate branch touted his endorsements from members of abbotts leadership team and advisers associated with senator ted cruz he also pointed to his career and a lawyer and a lawmaker willing to stand up for texans giving his push for a moment of silence in texas schools and recording votes in the legislature as examples you have to be smart and confident and its helpful to have a record of getting things done branch said i have a record of getting things done as a conservative  smitherman said the attorney general should be a leader not someone who cast votes he said his experience on the railroad and public utility commissions as well as a prosecutor make him the ideal choice to replace abbott when these guys were freshman legislators i was putting bad people in jail in houston he said its not a voting job the attorney general is not a policymaker  if you want somebody who has a record of voting thats not me  paxton a former house member disagreed with smitherman saying his record in the legislature and his career as a lawyer were indicative of whether he would keep his promise to be a strong conservative this record that he was diminishing is important because there are thousands of decisions that ive made on all kinds of issues paxton said if you want proof that someone is going to have a conservative framework in this particular position youve got an 11year consistent record  on most issues the candidates were in agreement they all were against a newly adopted san antonio ordinance that prohibits discrimination against gays and transgender residents those in violation of the law would be ineligible to serve on city boards and commissions this idea that you can be kicked off a city commission or board or that you could not contract with the city because you didnt have the right thoughts or beliefs or the right religious view is wrong paxton said this country was founded by people who came here for religious freedom and freedom of speech  branch agreed it was unconstitutional branch said even if you have a motivation to not discriminate against a certain group of folks then you cant solve that problem by discriminating against another group of folks in texas  smitherman took his opposition to the policy even further you may disagree with my point of view but i have the right to say it he said in my judgment this is not a civil rights issue and by trying to elevate themselves to be on par with race its an inappropriate way to try to gain that privilege  later an audience member questioned smitherman about comments he made this summer saying that men should not have premarital sex should marry a woman and have lots of children im an advocate of marriage smitherman said while i know people who are gay i dont agree with that lifestyle i love them i want them to be successful and happy but its been my experience that marriage committed marriage with children is a very good way to be happy and productive  paxton said he believed in marriage and doesnt dislike people who are gay its just a difference of opinion he said branch didnt directly answer the question i have five kids i guess i win he said the candidates differed on whether abbott should have joined us attorney general eric holder in opposing the merger between fort worthbased american airlines and us airways that merger should go through smitherman said its always a problem when government inserts itself into a commercial endeavor and thats what we have  paxton said government should generally stay out of such mergers there may be things about this particular issue that are confidential that general abbott knows that we dont know but in general i would not insert myself into these types of issues because i really believe businesses will make the right decisions he said branch gave abbott the benefit of the doubt the general has been an outstanding attorney general branch said i take the general at his word  he said hes working with american airlines to try to get a quick resolution  i hope we have a quick resolution  follow gromer jeffers jr on twitter at gromerjeffers

One Question Remains	2010-03-01	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2010/03/01/one-question-remains/	en	what do you say about this governors race that the trailer was better than the movie that sometimes a super bowl featuring the two best teams in the league turns into a blowout that texans who vote with their middle fingers differentiate between the bums in austin and the bums in washington that the pundits who expected a barnburner were full of chorizo whatever the real puzzler is will there be a runoff no public poll or vote count in more than three years has had governor rick perry at or above 50 percent which is what he needs to finish this off the last time he saw that number was in the 2006 primary when he pulled 84 percent against three noname candidates he won the general with 39 percent against a democrat two independents and two lesser lights since then every poll has had him in the high 30s and into the 40s hes close though recent polls have perry under 50 but appear to have enough undecided votes to put him over the top the possibility of a runoff evidently changed the perry campaigns strategy they were talking just a couple of weeks ago about pulling down all of their negative campaign ads replacing them with biographical and closing commercials and sailing lyrically to the end but the glow around debra medina and kay bailey hutchisons relatively steady numbers apparently convinced the perry folks to stick to what they were already running as medinas vote was bigger than the difference between hutchison and perry a runoff was the only outcome after the debates medina was off the air without the money to stay on television with advertising and completely dependent on free media which is what campaigns call news coverage that almost assured a drop in her support even without mistakes she made mistakes  a couple of doozies like the 911 thing gaffe on the glenn beck radio show  but the possibility of a runoff lingers perry has kept the negative ads up for a while longer and added a new spot that has him sitting in front of a texas flag talking about the 10th amendment and keeping washington out of our business  theres a dog whistle in there with a frequency aimed at medina voters telling them that perry is with them on the antiwashington stuff and that its time to come home in the gop primary if he can shrink hutchisons numbers or medinas hell have a chance at a in without a runoff and then he can start worrying about a businessfriendly wellfinanced democrat who wants a crack at him in november former houston mayor bill white isnt a washington guy and that frame might be out of style by october anyway white is hoarding money while the republicans fight  farouk shami and the five other democrats in that race havent mustered serious support when the republicans are done and that could happen next week the race to define white will begin with him painting the rosy picture and the gop candidate painting the gray one the runoff date is april 13 the republicans will either wrap it up next week or play a version of groundhog day with six more weeks of hyperactive television advertising and theres a sidebar to that too a runoff would likely cost each of the contestants another 10 million if they plan to stay on the tube and keep up the fight perry wants to avoid a runoff with her numbers hutchison has to be hoping shell get six more weeks to try to win this thing and medina wants either a runoff or a new forum a race for us senate perhaps rick green the former state representative now seeking a gop nomination to the texas supreme court is running an old endorsement video on his facebook page even though the famous pitchman died almost two years ago it runs about a minute and has this tagline this is what charlton heston once said about rick green and his service to the state of texas  the endorsement from the late heston actor and nra jefe was loaded onto greens political facebook page one month ago  the site also features a video made for greens 2002 race for state legislature by motivational speaker zig ziglar hes still alive  a close of the campaign letter from houston democrat jarvis johnson to his opponent us representative sheila jacksonlee accuses her of stealing his yard signs and not just the ones with his name on them  the ones in his yard check it out we are astonished and disappointed to learn that your campaign is stealing our campaign signs i woke up this morning to find that my family friends neighbors and supporters throughout the 18th congressional district had their jarvis johnson for congress signs stolen from the private property in front of their homes last night even the campaign signs in my own front yard were stolen miraculously your signs were left intact  he went on to say that theyd prosecute anybody they catch just a few more days  the republican challenger in hd7 david simpson appears to be ramping down instead of ramping up his 8day report says hes only spent 2900 recently  as opposed to the almost 29000 he showed spending in his 30report incumbent representative tommy merritt rlongview is doing things more traditionally almost 80000 spent this past month compared with 8000 in his january report simpson raised 19000 while merritt reported almost 41000  in hd20 republican milton rister had quite the 8day report seeing 46000 in contributions a big jump from the 1900 he had in his 30day report the contributions include 2500 from social conservative james leininger of san antonio and 25000 of bob and doylene perrys money but even with the impressive gains charles schwertner is still outspending rister by quite a bit schwertner reported 123000 in expenditures for the last month  more than double what his three competitors spent combined the perrys also gave 25000 to stephen thomas who used to head the texas residential construction commission  an agency set up less than ten years ago at the behest of builders like perry and euthanized by the legislature last year with that funding all three major candidates in the primary appear to have mailers out hoping a last piece of mail might make the difference  in hd83 senator robert duncan rlubbock found himself in an uncomfortable position hes not endorsing either his legislative colleague representative delwin jones rlubbock or his former employee zach brady jones sent out a mailer showing him with duncan and soon had to fend off charges that he was faking an endorsement the lubbock avalanchejournal reported that jones said he was only asserting that duncan and he work as a team in austin brady took issue with that brady maintains a slight lead over jones in both contributions and expenditures going into the last week of the race he raised 71000 to jones 66000 third musketeer charles perry lags behind although he says all three candidates have mailers in the field  just because your opponent drops out doesnt mean your people move on representative terri hodge ddallas withdrew from her primary race after pleading guilty to federal tax evasion but some of her supporters are still urging residents not to vote for her challenger eric johnson hodge is asking people to stop pushing her name but if she wins the most votes the districts precinct chairs would choose a new candidate some of them want to but johnson has secured support from many of the sitting democratic lawmakers in the area and a majority of precinct chairs and this week he reported 67000 in contributions and endorsements from parent pac and the texas association of realtors  according to their most recent campaign finance filings victor leal raised significantly more money than his opponent walter four price iv in the leadup to the hd87 primary and his expenditures were proportionally greater as the race entered its final days leal had 8833051 on hand as compared to prices 7238176 the amarillo globenews noted that over 60 percent of leals donations come from outside the district while over 50 percent of prices are from inside hd87  accusations are flying in hd98 and they are taking the form of mailers and websites incumbent

of leaving a few items off their resumes she accuses richard of voting for hillary clinton in the 2008 primary cheating on his business property taxes running dubious businesses including travel website fubiovcom and accepting the financial backing of extremists taylor gets sideswiped for telling the waco tribuneherald that he would stay in west south of waco stop for the kolaches whether or not he lost his 2006 bid for congress shortly before moving to plano reusing ads from his 2006 campaign in his current race and being a political carpetbagger  a spokesperson for the jackson campaign said its just a comparison of candidate resumes is all it is i dont think this qualifies as going negative  her opponents disagree richards campaign issued a response we have run an honest ethical grassroots campaign that is above board and without reproach richard says unfortunately one of my opponents has decided to attack me both personally and professionally and i can no longer sit idly by and allow these attacks to remain unaddressed  he says he was a rush limbaughinspired chaos voter in 2008 that his business property taxes have always been paid on time and in full and that his supporters are staunch conservatives who put their money where their mouth is  he even relaunched fubiovcom for those who want to dig around  or share their vacation experiences taylor also issued a response in which he characterizes the attacks as the most negative mail pieces in collin county history  far from trying to hide his 2006 run for us congress his campaign says he has repeatedly referred to the race in public forums  michael banks won a big victory in hd11 but it wasnt the primary the us supreme court denied an appeal by the city of dallas on a case that could have opened the door to turning a large expanse of east texas into a reservoir known as lake fastrill which would have been a cornerstone of the citys water plan instead the region will be a nature preserve banks cochair of friends of the neches river was very active in the fight against lake fastrill his efforts were acknowledged in an unlikely place  a celebratory press release from democratic agriculture commissioner candidate and fellow fastrill opponent hank gilbert who says the kudos were not political and he isnt taking sides in the race banks is running against representative chuck hopson of jacksonville who switched parties and is now running as a republican  larry gonzales found a friend in bob perry in the last weeks before the primary he and his wife doylene gave 70000 to gonzales bid in the hd52 gop primary that dwarfs what his opponents have raised  his closest competition in fundraising among the three other candidates is john gordon who has about 26565 on hand gonzales also released a tv ad last week on cable in the round rock taylor and north austin areas  on the last weekend before the district 146 democratic primary al edwards will hold a fight against violence aids

effectively been elected in the house 70 incumbents  31 democrats and 39 republicans  face no challenges in either the primary or general elections lucky them then there are the candidates whose races wont start until wednesday in 48 house races the incumbent went uncontested in the primary but has a general election opponent most of the uncontested primaries came on the democratic side likely thanks to the tea party movement drawing more attention to the gop of course the libertarians are mounting campaigns in many of these uncontested races but until they change their history of losing to

Who'll Control the Crayons Next Year?	2010-01-11	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2010/01/11/wholl-control-the-crayons-next-year/	en	as more candidate filings become available from the states bigger counties its apparent that republicans are going to have a noisy beginning to the year theyve got an unusual number of primary election challengers to their legislative incumbents democrats meanwhile are making a weak play for political control in the next decade thats not an assessment of whether their candidates can compete  its about whether theyre in position to make real gains even if they do win some elections redistricting comes around in 2011 and the minority party needs either a house majority or a majority of seats on an arcane legislative board to control the mapmaking they dont appear to be in position to do that in a year of active conservative protests against federal spending and economic and health policies texas legislators on the state and federal level face more competition than usual on this years ballots itll be about two weeks before candidates report their campaign finances  thatll be the first real clue as to the strength of the challengers and the incumbents they seek to depose texas democrats meanwhile are mounting a mild offensive on statewide offices that figure into redistricting the legislature will try to draw new political maps after the 2010 census if they fail or the governor vetoes their plans congressional maps will go to court and state maps will go to a fivemember panel that includes the lieutenant governor the speaker of the house the comptroller land commissioner and attorney general democrats didnt produce a comptroller candidate and recent resignations and party switches made it more difficult to take control of the house and the speakership next year theyd have to go threeofthree  winning lite guv attorney general and land commissioner to have a majority on the legislative redistricting board a different perspective a democrat of some repute take it either way points out that while there are weaknesses on the ticket nobody challenged the comptroller with her seat on the lrb  the democrats are a lot better off than they were in october and early november theres a solid andor wellfinanced candidates for governor now in farouk shami and bill white and the other candidates who were clamoring for that job have scattered either leaving tom schieffer or moving on to another race kinky friedman and hank gilbert for some democrats compared with the prospects before halloween or thanksgiving this ticket looks actually desirable the first monday of the year was the filing deadline for the 2010 elections and the parties published preliminary lists  that means they are maddeningly incomplete  of the people who want to run the state next year democrats and republicans will nominate their candidates in the march primaries libertarians had the same filing deadline but will choose their nominees in a series of county district and state conventions in march and june the lists come with caveats candidates whose districts dont cross county lines file with local party officials and not with the state the state parties are working to get accurate master lists only the libertarian list is full and complete at the moment they have ten days to gather names from the counties and to scrub and deliver the final rosters to the texas secretary of state which administers elections the full ballots as they stand now can be found in the election 2010 database at our sibling publication the texas tribune some notes from the filings  the biggest surprise of the deadline filers was former state senator hector uribe dbrownsville who broke a 14year absence from the ballot by filing for land commissioner hell face bill burton of athens in the democratic primary the winner will face incumbent republican jerry patterson in november cinema trivia fans uribe and patterson were both in the alamo  uribe as an actor and patterson as an extra and uribe had a speaking part in no country for old men and kinky friedman and hank gilbert will spar for the right to face republican agriculture commissioner todd staples in november  most of whats at the top of the ballot was known but some new folks joined the battle five libertarians want that job led by jeff daiell whos been on the ballot for houston city council us senate and for governor twice seven democrats filed including alma aguado felix alvarado bill dear clement glenn star locke farouk shami and bill white if nothing else that number raises the chances of a primary runoff on april 13  the high number of candidates could make it difficult for anyone to get more than 50 percent the republicans have three candidates and youve heard of all of them kay bailey hutchison debra medina and rick perry  linda chavezthompson joined the lieutenant governor field the san antonio labor leader will run against former travis county district attorney ronnie earle and restaurateur marc katz the winner will face incumbent republican david dewhurst in november  us representative sheila jackson lee dhouston drew a primary challenge from houston city councilman jarvis johnson the democrats didnt put up candidates for all of the statewide court seats on the ballot but the libertarians did six republicans and a democrat are after an open seat on the texas supreme court  a group that includes former state representative rick green of dripping springs  and two republicans and a democrat are in the running for the seat held since october by justice eva guzman of houston  house speaker joe straus elected just a year ago after a contentious couple of weeks didnt draw a majorparty opponent  denton county republicans myra crownover and burt solomons unexpectedly drew primary opponents shell face kurt hyde on march 2 hell face mike murphy  democrats are challenging republicans in all three texas supreme court slots on the ballot but left two of three rs on the other high court  the texas court of criminal appeals  unopposed  us representative ralph hall rrockwall drew five opponents in his own primary and one democrat us representative kevin brady rconroe drew three primary opponents and so did us representative ron paul rsurfside and republican kay granger of fort worth drew two  as expected representative chuck hopson of jacksonville will have opposition in his first gop primary this year hopson switched parties in november and some of his new friends had hoped to keep the field clear but two republicans in that east texas district are gunning for him in what should be one of the most interesting races on the ballot  the house ballot has three rematches on it in houston al edwards will be defending his seat against fellow democrat borris miles who won it away in 2006 and then lost the first rematch in 2008 nearby representative kristi thibaut dhouston will face the guy she beat last year former representative jim murphy rhouston in waco republican charles doc anderson will face democrat john mabry in november he beat mabry to win the seat in 2004  representative jim dunnam of waco the leader of the house democrats has an opponent leon county gop chair marva beck signed up on the last day to oppose him  and there were no lastminute resignations the only members who volunteered not to come back  one in the senate and eight in the house  announced their intentions well before the filing deadline if you dont have a calculator handy that means 100 percent of the congressional delegation 96 percent of the state senators and 95 percent of the state representatives want to come back the drops senator eliot shapleigh del paso and representatives frank corte rsan

opponents arent the same thing as competitors no libertarian has posed an electoral threat to a republican or democratic candidate in state office in past elections unless theres an upset of the most unusual kind in the offing theyre not likely to pull it off this time and some candidates from the major parties drew only libertarian opponents that list includes comptroller susan combs the only statewide executive official who didnt get a major party opponent two judges on the texas court of criminal appeals  lawrence meyers and cheryl johnson  will face libertarians but not democrats in the

dconroe has three primary opponents but no democrats entered that race kenny marchant rcoppell has one challenger in the gop primary as does john carter rgeorgetown three of the races for the state

conversely candidates in some races dont have to break a competitive sweat until later in the year lieutenant governor david dewhurst for instance doesnt have a primary fight but will face a democrat in november the race for attorney general is also a november contest with one republican one democrat and one libertarian in the hunt add in two statewide judicial races four congressional contests one sboe matchup two senate races and 29 house fights last we come to the brawlers  the races where theres a primary or two and then a general the candidates will have to fight in march and fight again in november that describes the race at the top of the bill which has seven democrats three republicans and five libertarians each thinks she or he should be the next governor of texas the democratic halves of the races for lite guv land and agriculture commissioners all feature primaries the winners of which will battle republican incumbents in november but rick perry is the only statewide officeholder whos being challenged both in march and november us representative ralph hall rrockwall will see challenges across the calendar as will michael mccaul raustin mike conaway rmidland kay granger rfort worth ron paul rsurfside ruben hinojosa dmercedes sheila jackson lee dhouston and ciro rodriguez dsan antonio former representative ken mercer a san antonio republican whos now on the sboe will face both spring and fall opponents carlos uresti dsan antonio is the only state senator with both a primary fight and a general election fight in front of him as for the texas house patrick rose ddripping springs has opposition in march and november plenty of members face a democrat or a republican next year but hes the only one wholl face both what seemed like a mountain on wednesday might in fact be a molehill this week governor rick perry announced his intention to promote constitutional amendments to limit spending in texas causing cheers from supporters and jeers from critics but upon further review the amendments might not be worth the uproar perry outlined two amendments one would limit spending increases to the rate of inflation and population growth while the other would require a twothirds majority to raise taxes first of all the proposals werent exactly new perry campaign spokesperson catherine frazier described the governors announcement as reiterating his priority which was outlined a year ago in perrys state of the state speech then theres the fact that lawmakers already spend within the proposed limits according to both the center for public policy priorities and the texas taxpayers research association the spending limitation has mattered far less than the conservatism of the legislature said dale craymer of ttra such amendments dont eliminate all mischief explains craymer because there are a lot of things that states can do administratively that harm taxpayers but dont raise taxes  craymer whose group represents businesses that pay corporate sales property and other taxes in the state points to the 2003 session when during tight economic times the legislature avoided raising taxes but also denied taxpayers their tax refunds eventually the comptroller allowed individuals to claim the refunds as tax credits taxpayers ended up suffering craymer says despite the fact that taxes technically stayed the same unsurprisingly perrys chief rival had a negative take on his plan us senator kay bailey hutchisons camp called the announcement an election year ploy  campaign spokesman joe pounder argued that the governor already had the power to control spending and tax increases with his veto pen i dont understand why rick perry needs twothirds of the legislature to prevent a tax increase if he could just veto a tax increase pounder said scott mccown at cppp says that while the proposed limits would not have affected much in the last few years theyre not a good idea hes concerned over future limitations such amendments would cause just because texas is consistently one of the lowest spending states doesnt mean it should be he says mccown hopes to see increased funding for education and other social programs  and the amendments might prevent such growth going forward we need to spend more than population growth and inflation and this would not allow us to do that he said preventing that sort of expansion is exactly why some people say the proposals are important i think rather objectively you can say that what weve done works says michael sullivan of empower texans which advocates for limited government but a big chunk of it has been because we have had some pretty good rightthinking people in place   by abby rapoport the young conservatives of texas on wednesday released its scorecard of the 81st legislative session complete with an updated list of the gops republicans in name only rinos and the sessions most liberal legislators legislators were graded on how often they voted in line with the groups own principals which include the belief that the declaration of independence recognizes the freedom of an individual as inherited from one sovereign god and predictably that the states of this nation are and of right ought to be free and independent  because their lifetime voting records fall in line with the ycts agenda less than 50 percent of the time republican sens kip averitt of waco and kevin eltife of tyler made the groups rino list as did representatives charlie geren of fort worth tommy merritt of longview and delwin jones of lubbock who sided with the yct less than 60 percent everyone on that list save eltife drew at least one primary opponent in 2010 the report includes a new analysis that compares how committee chairs voted during the last two sessions a barometer of sorts to measure committee action during the tenure of republican house speaker joe straus rsan antonio and contrast it to the performance under his predecessor representative tom craddick rmidland one of the most telling ways to measure a speaker is to evaluate who he appointed as committee chairs because these people truly dominate the legislative process said tony mcdonald the tycs vicechairman of legislative affairs if the tyc ruled over state politics straus would be sent out to pasture as committee chairs slid an average of 25 points according to the groups scorecard representative rafael anchia of dallas was bestowed the honor of most liberal legislator for never voting in line with the group and shares space on the list with more than two dozen lawmakers all democrats who pleased the yct 10 percent of the time or less the yct relied mainly on record votes on bills considered for second reading in the house and on the motion to suspend the regular order of business in the senate the two votes are the most important in determining whether a piece of legislation moves forward and therefore are the best point in the legislative process to measure our representatives positions explained mcdonald  by julian aguilar former representative timoteo garza deagle pass got unconvicted on procedural grounds by the 5th us circuit court of appeals he and his mom and dad were convicted on charges they misappropriated money from the lucky eagle casino run by the kickapoo tribe for personal and political use isidro garza jr is a former

if you think about after about 10 years of haircuts youre caught up  linda chavezthompson who is running against the incumbent republican lieutenant governor on differences between her and her 6 5 opponent im shorter than david dewhurst thats an attribute nobody else can say they have  texas ranks fortysixth among all states in health care and first in its percentage of uninsured citizens one in five texans has no health insurance the top four diagnosed causes of death among texans are heart disease cancer stroke and respiratory diseases such as emphysema in addition to killing us smoking and obesity cause preventable diseases that are very expensive to treat and a significant loss of workforce productivity including increased absenteeism and disability meanwhile two trends will soon strain our medical care system the first is that texas is aging if roughly one in ten texans today is over age 65 in 2050 one in six will be over 65 the second is that the rates of childhood and adult obesity here continue to rise with the shifting racial and ethnic profile of the state they rise faster here than in many other parts of the country the demand for care and the cost of care for seniors will compete with the demand and cost of care for the increasing number of texans who are obese and as a result have also been or will be diagnosed with heart disease cancer diabetes or some forms of arthritis all of these conditions are treatable but theyre expensive to treat and occupy the attention of a physician workforce that is in short supply while the national health reform debate of late has centered on universal insurance coverage and cost control lets be clear whether were talking national health reform or texasspecific health reform the prize is optimal health for all which among other positive benefits will surely reduce the demand for medical care of preventable diseases the texas health agenda for 2010 then should help texans stay or become as optimally healthy as possible and provide access to preventive chronic and acute care   when appropriate and necessary three strategies can move texas in the right direction a statewide indoor smoking ban statewide universal k12 coordinated school health programs and the serious consideration of all available options to reduce the number of uninsured texans ill start with the last one first there is no doubt that insuring more texans will be an expensive proposition however for a state that takes pride in its christian values and sensibilities as it well should universal insurance is a moral imperative in the spirit of the good samaritan furthermore the cost associated with increasing the number of insured texans could be lessened by banning indoor smoking in all public places and assuring that all schools have coordinated health programs that improve the quality of food in the schools make physical education a daily expectation and incorporate healthy lifestyle lessons into the daily curriculum smoking tobacco increases the likelihood of premature disease disability and death from heart disease lung cancer and emphysema indoor smoking bans are associated with a fairly immediate reduction of admissions to hospitals for myocardial infarctions or heart attacks fewer myocardial infarctions are good for families theres less grief and anguish good for employers less sick leave disability and medical care costs and good for medical care systems less of a cost to the public system and less demand for care in sometimes overcrowded emergency room settings smoking bans make it easier for those who want to quit smoking to do so and more difficult for those who want to start to do so  particularly adolescents a statewide indoor smoking ban is a relatively inexpensive way to reduce medical care utilization and cost and improve the health of texans coordinated school health programs hold the promise of reversing and preventing childhood obesity not only do they improve childrens health but theyre associated with improved academic performance and decreased disciplinary problems high school graduation and some college education is associated with better adult health status childhood obesity is on the rise it threatens the health of children when theyre children and when they become adults the cost of universal coordinated school health programs is on the order of 10 to 15 per child per year in contrast to a cost of approximately 1000 per year for medical care better health and better academic performance make this a mustdo the ultimate goal is the best health possible for each texan and for all texans a healthy workforce and healthy texas children mean a state that competes effectively for business the 2010 health agenda for texas therefore should be about the publics health the health of 24 million texans a physically healthy texas is a fiscally healthy texas  eduardo sanchez md mph was commissioner of the texas department of state health services from 2004 to 2006 and the texas department of health from 2001 to 2004 he is currently a vice president and chief medical offer for blue cross and blue shield of texas unemployment trends are reversing and thankfully more of our states employers are opening their doors to new employees however in order to restore jobs lost during the recession and to prepare for those ready to enter the job market texas must create more than two million jobs in the next decade according to the us chamber of commerce that wont be easy but the good news is that we are starting to make progress a key factor in texas achieving this job growth target is having educated employees available to fill positions as they become available a recent article in the economist noted that while texas enjoys the best business climate in america future problems related to education could erode that status dramatically the texas association of business believes texas must establish a longterm goal of raising the education attainment of its workforce to a globally competitive level of 55 percent of the working age population age 2564 holding an associate degree or above by the year 2030 the business community pays for twothirds of the cost of educating our children and will be the ultimate consumers of their knowledge when companies seek to fill jobs as such the texas business community must step up to the plate as a critical friend of education by demanding firstclass education and firstclass results beyond the obvious economic imperative a moral imperative exists that challenges the texas education system to produce stronger results in order to meet the target of restoring and creating more goodpaying jobs the business community must engage at both the state and local level to that end we should all support three changes to our education system implement an honest accountability system the current academic accountability system is reminiscent of enron in many ways for example the system rewards schools for the academic performance that they expect to happen but that has not yet actually occurred this backwards process has caused a falsepositive spike in the number of schools rated exemplary or recognized now at 61 this same system also gives schools ratings such as academically acceptable where 49 of the students can fail sections of the texas assessment of knowledge and skills as if those statistics are not outrageous enough the texas education agency which implements the education standards set by the legislature has the audacity to claim that the texas dropout rate is only 12 everybody knows the number to be much greater the current education system will not allow texas to remain globally competitive if texans were unflinchingly honest about how our students are truly performing we would be able to fully address the scope of the issue the ball is in the court of the texas education agency to account for the real numbers foster a collegegoing culture our students must be engrained with the expectation that they will attain postsecondary education while at the same time providing them with the information and tools necessary to do so the texas higher education coordinating board is already taking important steps in educating texans about the financial options available for students and their families who worry about how they will pay for academic options create a resultsbased higher education finance system texas must alter the funding formulas it uses for higher education and base them on the successful completion of courses not simply classroom attendance adult basic education and remedial education must be funded along similar lines in order to ensure that the money is being used in the production of results not just to support education bureaucracy the biggest threat to our business climate is a future workforce that is illprepared to meet the demands of an increasingly sophisticated job market if our students fall short of employer expectations industries will simply leave texas and go to a state that has a steady supply of educated young adults prepared to fill their expectations stakeholders must fight to heighten our education standards otherwise texas and its students will be left behind addressing our education system must be priority number one in 2010  bill hammond is president and ceo of the texas association

On the Ballot: Taxes, Property, and College	2009-10-26	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2009/10/26/on-the-ballot-taxes-property-and-college/	en	by reeve hamilton the texas tribune  early voting is under way but texans  at least those who do this kind of thing  will vote on 11 proposed amendments to the texas constitution on november 3 some already started early voting began this week and runs through october 30 experiencing significant crossfire is a cluster of amendments 2 3 and 5 dealing with property tax appraisals all three stem from house joint resolution 36 prop 2 stops a home from being appraised based on its value as commercial property  or its best use  some wonder why if the money a big box store could pay a homeowner for their land is real the communities shouldnt consider that when procuring much needed tax dollars for their school district others like representative ralph sheffield rtemple feel that burdening select citizens with higher taxes is wrong and its time to make it unconstitutional  there would be uniform statewide standards for property appraisal if prop 3 passes if senator jeff wentworth rsan antonio is right this is that rarity when there is no opposition to an issue related to state government  this ignores vocal opposition from local control advocates who prefer counties enforcing standards themselves colorful agitator linda curtis of independent texans calls it truly rotten and the trojan horse of this election  the runt of this litter prop 5 allows separate appraisal districts to combine with legislative approval rural districts could benefit because they have trouble staffing their review boards the austin chronicle called this entirely trivial  as opposed to the merely trivial prop 3  and then endorsed both what crossfire a chain email that mislabels these as propositions 1 2 and 3 has made its way around the state claiming if you own a home and these laws are passed you will be taxed by the state  representative john otto rdayton one of the bills coauthors has been scrambling to assure voters thats blatantly false  the texas constitution prohibits a state property tax otto along with senator tommy williams rthe woodlands has launched a new website under the auspices of star pac that williams says anyone confused or concerned about the effect of these propositions should visit  elected officials are climbing over each other to endorse the prop 4 plan to devote state funds to developing more tier one universities governor rick perry already voted for it senator kirk watson daustin calls it a big deal  a onceinageneration opportunity to supercharge our economy help our universities and create a lasting inheritance for future generations  democratic gubernatorial candidate tom schieffer and senator dan patrick rhouston are on board despite prominent republican support young conservatives of texas came out against the measure in a youtube video calling for a wiser investment the final amendment in the spotlight is prop 11 which limits the states eminent domain authority this is the first time texans will vote on the issue since the 2005 us supreme court kelo v new london decision rivals us senator kay bailey hutchison and governor rick perry have both made a show of their support for this protection of private citizens on the other hand it may be unnecessary on his website representative scott hochberg dhouston explains the legislature has already passed a law providing protections against abuse of eminent domain authority  also being considered is prop 8 proposing a state fund to help veterans hospitals some say its a federal issue but state sens juan chuy hinojosa dmcallen and eddie lucio jr dbrownsville and democratic us senate candidate john sharp say people should vote early because when it comes to veterans a yes vote is too important to risk waiting  prop 9 writes access to public beaches into the state constitution unfazed by arguments that private property rights might be infringed upon land commissioner jerry patterson opined can you imagine driving your family to the beach for summer vacation only to find a high fence covered with no trespassing signs  tax dollars could go to buy up land for buffer zones around military bases if prop 1 passes empower texans a conservative pac fears it allows local entities to incur debt and raise property taxes in attempts to keep federal installations that may no longer be necessary to the militarys mission or performance  but if those bases are lost supporters fear for the security and economy of the surrounding communities prop 7 grants members of the texas state guard an exception to an arguably antiquated law that says civil servants cant hold two government positions it has the support of bipartisan coalition of representative phil king rweatherford representative dan flynn rvan representative aaron pena dedinburg and representative ryan guillen drio grande city prop 6 lets the veterans land board issue bonds to help veterans with home loans and land purchases prop 10 extends term limits for stateelected emergency services districts from two years to four voters passions arent coalescing on either side for these two by brandi grissom the texas tribune  longtime el paso state senator eliot shapleigh wont seek reelection in 2010 he joins steve ogden rbryan on the lame duck list ogden said earlier he wont return his surprise announcement set off speculation about his plans for higher office  and a vigorous fight to replace him while other public service may lie ahead i will not run for the texas senate in 2010 shapleigh said during each day of the last decade we have endeavored to do our very best for the people of our great community and state  shapleigh said he had been weighing the decision for several weeks but the announcement came as a shock to his staff and to many in the political arena ive done what i came to do shapleigh said shapleigh would not say specifically what office he will seek but he did rule out a challenge to el paso democratic us representative silvestre reyes my dreams have never been in congress he said shapleigh said repeatedly that texas needs change at the highest state levels but he would not say whether he planned to run for statewide office he didnt say no either an announcement about his future plans he said would come in about three weeks after he has some time to relax shapleighs good friend el paso county attorney jos rodriguez was one of the few people not surprised by fridays news rodriguez said shapleigh told him last week he planned not to seek reelection during that conversation he said shapleigh mentioned that he might consider a run for statewide office shapleigh was elected to the senate in 1996 and helped lead efforts to establish a fouryear medical school in el paso the first on the usmexico border he has been among the most liberal democrats in the texas senate a vocal critic of republican leadership and a lonely proponent of establishing a state income tax he has fought to fund services for low and middleincome families and chastised conservatives for slashing the budgets for childrens health insurance and other programs shapleighs departure leaves open a senate seat that has rarely been vacated only three people all democrats have held the seat since 1973 shapleigh peggy rosson who served from 1991 to 1997 and tati santiesteban who held the seat from 1973 to 1991 potential successors  mostly democrats  are already stacking up its a solidly democratic seat over the last two election cycles the average statewide democrat beat the average statewide republican by 257 percentage points rodriguez said he plans to announce an exploratory committee to run for the senate soon i am going to be trying to gain support both here locally and in austin in the next 30 days or so he said representative norma chavez del paso said you bet shes going to consider a run for the senate seat i finished my seventh term im an accomplished legislator who will obviously look seriously at the senate race chavez said adding that she was already planning to do a countywide poll in november to gauge her support representative joe pickett del paso thought about it and decided not to run im just going to cool my jets said pickett who had floated the idea last week the chairman of the house transportation committee said he is happy with his position in the lower chamber and he doesnt see a move to the senate as a step up i dont need to run for the senate he said im in a really good spot for el paso  asked whether hed support any of the current candidates who have expressed interest in the el paso senate seat pickett said he was keeping his powder dry for now former republican representative pat haggerty caught during a round of golf in austin said he would consider running but he added that a republican couldnt win that seat if i ran it wouldnt be as a republican he said other names circulating in the potential candidate list today include el paso mayor john cook and republican businessman dee margo who challenged shapleigh in 2006 margo reached at a reunion in nashville tenn said he still hasnt made any decisions about running in 2010 he had previously said he wouldnt run against shapleigh asked whether todays news changed the equation margo said i doubt it but i dont know  by julian aguilar contributor to the texas tribune  political allies and a noisy and very public divorce dominate the conversation so far in representative tara rios ybarras effort to win a second term in the texas house the democratic lawmakers support from texans for lawsuit reform a group that gives generously to republicans continued this week tlr gave her its civil justice leadership award in harlingen though tlrs support was crucial to her primary victory last year over incumbent representative juan escobar of kingsville rios ybarra said their backing indicates her probusiness leanings not her party affiliation jm lozano a south texas businessman vying for the freshmans hd43 seat said her support from the group reflects the democratic incumbent might be out of touch with her own party any political action committee is going to say they are bipartisan but when you see who funds them tlr they are not lozano said in south texas when you get into these communities you cannot abandon your constituents if 90 percent of your constituents are democrats you better stay loyal to your party  despite the publicity surrounding her financial support from tlr rios ybarra downplayed the issue i am a probusiness candidate she said there are different organizations that will make contributions based on my stance with that and there is a way to be probusiness and proenvironment and proworker and proeverything else one is not mutually exclusive to each other  campaign finance reports show tlr has given to democrats but favors republicans  something lozano claimed could up his chances of claiming a democratic primary election victory next year not so said rios ybarra adding that lawsuit reform is just one item in a cornucopia of issues that when settled will lead to job growth first of all our issues are not lawsuit reform our issues are very clearly jobs education and health care she said and so i talk to constituents i am not in austin working the lobby  lozano who is at the helm of three restaurant franchises in his district and the son of a medical doctor said he believes frivolous lawsuits should be addressed but that tlr does not distinguish between frivolous and legitimate issues rios ybarra must also contend with her current divorce proceedings after splitting with richard ybarra the state representative admitted in a deposition that she was having an intimate relationship with developer and campaign contributor clayton brashear after she filed for divorce but she said her personal life  public as it has now become  is irrelevant when it comes to her politics there are so many important issues for my district and for south texas right now that there is not really time to get distracted she said lozano said he has followed the divorce proceedings not to sling mud but to prepare himself for whatever may come next he says hes considering his options should rios ybarra drop out of the race and someone else jump in chances of that look slim however according to rios ybarra she and her exhusband still attend public functions together she said and have agreed to put the best interests of their two children first our objective is to raise two healthy children she said former capitol reporter james bernsen says now that he wont challenge representative diana maldonado dround rock in next years elections hell back larry gonzales instead last year maldonado won what had been a republican seat and the gop wants it back there are four people on the republican side still looking at the race john gordon stephen casey and ralph pia have all shown interest in addition to gonzales bernsen says he got into the contest about the same time gonzales did that he took at look at it and that he decided larry is the better candidate im going to support him   senator jane nelson rlewisville will seek another term she won her spot in 1992 and has held it continuously since then five senators have more seniority than she does three others came to the senate the same time she did  representative mark homer dparis will have an opponent in the person of erwin cain a como lawyer and businessman who is also chairman of the hopkins county gop republicans regularly beat the stuffing out of democrats in that sixcounty district  on the statewide level in the last two elections the difference averaged 203 percentage points in favor of the republicans  but homer has held off serious challenges over several cycles and homer says hell seek a seventh term in next years elections thats hd3  not running donna keel a republican who challenged representative valinda bolton daustin in 2008 she sent a note to fellow republicans saying its not the right time to run again but that shell support the republican nominee  san antonio lawyer tim tuggey managing partner of tuggey rosenthal pauerstein sandoloski agather will run in the gop primary for the state board of education hes got his eyes on the seat now held by former state representative ken mercer whos also a republican and is also from san antonio tuggey who served on san antonios via board said in his announcement that hes concerned about alleged ethical lapses in sboes management of the permanent school fund another republican incumbent on the sboe  don mcleroy  also faces a challenger in the gop primary next year lobbyist thomas ratliff is taking him on  the political fire drill in the el paso delegation continues with naomi gonzalezs announcement that shell run for the texas house seat occupied now by democrat norma chavez chavez is in the hunt  not officially but in  for eliot shapleighs senate seat the allegiances are tricky here shapleighs decision not to run again prompted el paso county attorney jos rodriguez to start exploring the race along with chavez gonzalez works for rodriguez as an assistant county attorney and finished second in a 2008 race for city council  freshman representative allen fletcher rtomball will seek a second term in hd130 he knocked off incumbent representative corbin van arsdale in the gop primary in 2008  john sharp picked up an endorsement for his us senate bid from dan richards son of the late governor ann richards  dan gattis running for the sd5 senate seat won endorsements from round rock mayor alan mcgraw and from five of mcgraws predecessors  lieutenant governor david dewhurst being interviewed on dallas radio said two or three senators were planning to move on before the next session we know of steve ogden and eliot shapleigh a republican and a democrat whove said they wont seek reelection but three dewhurst was apparently referring to florence shapiro rplano whos raising money to run for the us senate should kay bailey hutchison resign her spot dewhurst is also interested in the hutchison job by brian thevenot the texas tribune  some 30000 highly qualified texas public school teachers dont actually meet the federal definition for that standard  which could jeopardize their jobs and will certainly cause bureaucratic headaches for them and their school systems the teachers in question did not take a required general knowledge exam but rather believed  on the advice of the texas education agency  that a specific subject knowledge test would suffice the snafu apparently due to a miscommunication between state and federal bureaucrats was disclosed in a letter from the texas education agency to school systems districts across the state seek to have 100 percent highly qualified staff to meet federal standards under the no child left behind act  meaning many of the teachers in question might not have been hired in the first place said texas education agency spokeswoman debbie ratcliffe the agency stressed in its correspondence however that it has asked federal authorities to review the matter and that many teachers may be able to complete the requirements and gain the highly qualified designation the 30000 figure is just a guess  based on typical turnover in a state with 321000 teachers ratcliffe said and it might well be a wrong guess as it turns out tea might be revising the number of highly qualified teachers who didnt actually earn that qualification on wednesday tea said the number of teachers affected could reach 30000 but that number was called into question thursday when the houston and austin systems  which educate more than a quarter  about six percent of the state public school population  reported that less than 30 of their teachers would be affected texas education commissioner robert scott repeated the 30000 figure in an interview thursday later when told of such small numbers in large districts ratcliffe said the figure she had supplied a day earlier was a worstcase scenario and that the agency had not yet done enough research to determine the true number given the houston and austin totals the number could be much lower she said the term highly qualified comes from the federal no child left behind act and generally has replaced state certification standards the problem here stems from differing interpretations by the texas and us education departments over qualifications to gain the credential federal monitors who visited the agency last month however disabused them of the notion that subjectspecific tests would suffice for elementary teachers who teach multiple subjects they sent the state a ruling which it forwarded to districts the state has asked for federal leniency in the matter but as it told districts in the letter there may be little or no flexibility from us education officials on the designations its a significant concern ratcliffe said sometimes it can take months to get an answer from the feds and in texas if they want to nonrenew a contract they have to tell the teacher by march and of course they have to start hiring by then it has all kinds of implications she said in addition according to the tea letter school systems will have to ensure that those teachers who dont qualify are not being paid by federal grants funds such as the title i program which aims to improve education for children in poverty and texas has tens of thousands of public school students in those programs and can get the federal funds if their teachers meet the federal standard ratcliffe said the states unemployment rate hit 82 percent in september up from 8 percent in august and 51 percent in september 2008 there were 996000 people unemployed last month according to the texas workforce commission three areas of the state have unemployment levels over 10 percent mcallenedinburgmission at 116 percent beaumontport arthur and brownsvilleharlingen both at 108 percent the lowest rate in the state according to twc was lubbock where 57 percent of labor force was out of work see how far we buried this in the newsletter still in a letter to supporters us senator kay bailey hutchison vows to stay in federal office until the health care debate is over the us senate is now debating legislation that would dramatically expand federal government control over our health care system she writes its important that you know i will not leave this fight i will remain in the senate this fall to help lead opposition to any government takeover of onesixth of our economy  the timing of the letter roughly coincides with hutchisons comments on a radio show mark davis wbapam last week when she was vague about when she might leave the federal job to concentrate on her challenge to sitting republican governor rick perry she said a few months ago  to reporters in general and on that same radio show in particular  that she would resign in october or november october looks unlikely now and the timing of a congressional vote on health care might be best left to bettors and political consultants the texas primary is fourandahalf months away while she says shell stay in office she throws several spears in perrys direction in the letter saying the state has a highest numbers of uninsured citizens that property taxes are the highest in the nation that our highways are lagging and txdot is broke and that our children are quitting school at alarming rates  hutchison says 14 years of oneman rule is too long  later in the letter she calls herself a reformer quite frankly i believe the lobbyists and insiders in our state capitol could use an infusion of new conservative thinking and new ideas  a cleanup of business as usual in a city that badly needs it  adam haynes is leaving tipro the texas independent producers and royalty owners association after five years for a job with chesapeake energy one of tipros member companies governor rick perry named r david kelly of dallas to chair the teacher retirement system of texas and appointed todd barth seth crone and nanette sissney to that board kelly is a partner with carleton residential properties in dallas barth is an attorney and president of bowers properties in houston

Something Special	2009-06-15	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2009/06/15/something-special/	en	there will be a special session to finish work left undone by the legislature but the final date hasnt been chosen and governor rick perry has declined to say whats going to be on the agenda several issues have dominated the conversation about special session topics extending the lives of five agencies that were left to die at the end of the regular session authorizing the sale of 2 billion in transportation bonds approved by voters almost two years ago and changing state law to allow the texas department of transportation to proceed with publicprivate partnerships also called comprehensive development agreements or cdas and a revolving fund using those bonds to go forward without waiting for the next regular legislative session perry confined his remarks to renewing the expiration dates on five agencies the legislature stranded at the end of the regular session the way i see this these are really pretty simple to address and we can get in here and i think in a very short period of time take care of the peoples business and let the members get on back to their joyous vacations and whatever else they have going on  perry said well do it hopefully sooner rather than later  the senate closed the session on the first day of the month without voting to extend the lives of five agencies that were up for a periodic review if those sunset reviews arent completed in time lawmakers typically extend the automatic shutdown dates for the agencies in question that didnt happen this time because of a housesenate spat transportation insurance and three other agencies are now set to go out of business in september 2010 unless lawmakers return before then transportation has some particular problems to fix the expiration date is at the top of the list if the agency doesnt get its date changed officials there have doubts about whether they can legally let new contracts next on their list lawmakers didnt authorize the sale of 2 billion in bonds approved by voters in 2007 the state budget would let txdot sell the bonds starting in january but the agency cant do anything without the authorization that bond money is needed for about a third of the lettings in next years agency budget the legislature also stopped before approving a revolving fund that would have leveraged the transportation bonds  borrowed against them  to raise up to 5 billion more for toll roads and other projects and that ties into the cdas or partnerships between private firms and the state on toll roads and other projects that all goes on the back burner for two years if the legislature doesnt act that argues for a special session sooner rather than later but theres the matter of a political year in 2010 and perry wants to avoid anything that looks like things arent running smoothly in austin hell be running against us senator kay bailey hutchison arguing that things arent running smoothly in washington a legislative mess now could turn into a political mess in the march primary democrats fear perry will add voter id to the agenda if he calls a special session that could be an obstacle to a deal on the transportation issues perry could cut a deal with the democrats  fix transportation and well leave voter id alone  but that could upset his own supporters perry hasnt said for sure what will be on the agenda  and what wont but if he wants a short session as he has said its not likely that hell add anything controversial to the list house speaker joe straus released the names of 111 state representatives who he says have pledged to elect him to a second term as speaker in january 2011 straus says a few more names have trickled in since he released this list  hes now released two supplemental lists  and says hes confident hes got the support he needs for another two years in the job straus republicans hold a 7674 majority in the texas house a few of the democrats who pledged to the speaker did so he said with the understanding that theyll leave the fold if democrats win the majority in the next election cycle most just signed the pledge card he said straus hasnt presented the members with a set of ideas about what hed do with a second term  thatll come later he said but he wants to play a role in setting the agenda in his second session  something he didnt have time to develop in his sudden rise from sophomore member to speaker in january the full lists follow signed democrats 55 roberto alonzo carol alvarado rafael anchia valinda

fundraising by state law his primary challenger is not and says her finance committee will match contributions to her campaign from now until the end of the month in her latest pitch to potential supporters us senator kay bailey hutchison says her finance committee will match contributions but that comes after she takes some jabs at governor rick perry a fellow republican for what she calls mismanagement and a failure of leadership as i travel the state people have expressed frustration with the current leadership in austin they tell me the governor is putting his personal political agenda in front of an agenda that will move the state forward and you know what i agree with them she wrote we find ourselves at a crossroads people from all parts of texas feel it is time for a change in austin after nearly a decade in office our governor is not offering a clear vision of how we can solve the issues facing a changing state and there is a real sense that our leadership in austin is getting distracted and consumed attempting to clean up the mismanagement problems caused at the governors agencies picking a fight with the federal government is not a longterm strategy to move texas forward  the letter said elected state officials cant raise money during a legislative session or during the 20day veto period that follows that blocks perry and other texas pols from trying to fill their treasuries before the end of the current reporting period which ends june 30 but federally elected officials like hutchison arent bound by that law so she gets to work the circuit while he cant and its one reason why she should be able to show bigger numbers when those reports are unveiled july 15 once again the only thing the senator has to offer is negative washington rhetoric said perry spokesman mark miner after seeing hutchisons pitch the thousands of people moving to texas she mentions in the letter are the result of a fiscally responsible government jobs good schools and roads and low taxes all a result of the work by governor perry and the legislature if the senators idea of success is whats going on in washington all texans should be concerned  hutchisons entire letter is available online milton rister who resigned last week as executive director of the texas legislative council is exploring a run for the texas house rister a georgetown republican is looking at the hd20 seat currently held by republican dan gattis theres a string here that starts with speculation that senator steve ogden rbryan will leave the legislature he told the austin americanstatesman last week that hell make a decision in the fall gattis is a possible candidate for that senate seat and has told supporters hed be interested that would leave his spot open gattis says he talked with rister and thinks its a conditional thing gattis says he will definitely run for senate if ogden does retire in that case rister would run for the gattis seat rister reached later confirmed that saying hell support ogden and gattis if they seek reelection to the jobs theyve got now rister a former political consultant for former house speaker tom craddick and others held staff positions with senator jane nelson lieutenant governor david dewhurst and was executive director of the republican party of texas before signing on as head of the tlc three years ago he  announced his resignation from that job last week hes run for office twice before in 1986 for midland county commissioner and in 1994 for williamson county judge he got 14 percent in the first race and 42 percent in the second im shooting for 51 percent this time he says as expected comptroller susan combs says the state has all the money it needs for the budget lawmakers approved during the legislative session combs didnt comment on the economy or offer any reservations in  her letter to state leaders she just said theres enough in the till to cover the bills texas lawmakers filed 12226 bills and resolutions during the regular session or nearly 2000 more than they filed in 2007  the previous record year if you throw out resolutions  including the 190 proposed constitutional amendments the 372 nonbinding concurrent resolutions whose main purpose is to display the legislatures opinions and the 4245 plain resolutions mostly used for commemoration memorials and such  they filed 7419 house and senate bills thats more than ever  a 199 percent increase over the 2007 total take solace they passed 1459 bills  23 fewer than two years ago the statistics from the last ten sessions courtesy of the texas legislative reference library show the latest one was busier than average if down a bit from the last they were busier than average both in terms of bills filed and bills passed they set the record for filings but fell well short of the 1999 highwater mark of 1622 for bills passed they were off the charts with all their resolving stuff one number is still missing

political consultant kelly fero at issue an online posting accusing keel of helping montford in the runoff keel says the website that posted that belongs to fero who was on lehmbergs campaign payroll

complaint frivolous and said the statements on the blog werent  in legal terms  campaign communications theres no violation of state election laws he said you can say anything you want on your blog this is not an ad  and he suggested keel wouldnt have filed a complaint if the election werent imminent this all about tuesday wood said fero called keel one of travis countys most litigious republicans and poohpoohed the complaint terry keel carries his law license like a bludgeon whether hes trying to bully a judicial opponent off the ballot or punish a democrat who caught him trying to affect a democratic runoff fero said with the primaries now complete none of the incumbents in statewide offices or in the texas congressional delegation have fallen nor have any state senators put

interests when the court decided it last year its a workers compensation case that turns on whether a company can avoid premise liability by labeling itself a general contractor a worker hurt on entergy property sued but was tossed because the company was acting as a general contractor and paying workers compensation premiums the court didnt set a date for the rehearing the rehearing of a unanimous ruling could take the issue off the table in this years political races three incumbent justices are on the ballot in november  youd have predicted this if you sat down and thought about it but the fundraising pitch for house democrats in texas is the same one tom craddick and the republicans used in the 1990s when they were in the minority the texas house democratic campaign committee says democrats need only five seats to a majority  they tout the distance theyve covered from a low point of 88 republicans and 62 democrats to the current 7971 the leader of that group waco representative jim dunnam is borrowing a page from the current speaker who ran campaigns called 76 in 96 and 8 in 98 on his way to winning a majority after redistricting in 2002 that election year flipped the republicans from a 7278 minority to an 8862 majority  the tax courts are out of the comptrollers control now they were moved last year to the state office of administrative hearings and

the spot currently held by senator kyle janek rhouston who has announced hell resign at the end of may that probably sets up a special election on november 4 to fill the last two years of janeks fouryear term  democrat kristi thibaut got her second endorsement from annies list a pac set up to elect democratic women to the legislature she had the groups endorsement two years ago against the same republican representative jim murphy of houston thibaut got 417 percent the first time but her supporters are betting the presidential contest will change the math in hd133 state and local governments will cover about 7 million of the costs of holding the ncaa mens final four in san antonio with a fund designed to make texas attractive for big events like that comptroller susan combs wants to expand the program in time for the 2011 super bowl in arlington allowing promoters to cover the expenses of more events that will in turn bring in more tax money the state has four funds set up to lure sporting and other events that could  without a competitive edge  go to other states for big sporting events like the final four or the super bowl the state figures up the economic impact and what it means in terms of taxes on sales hotel rooms motor vehicles and drinks they agree to reimburse approved expenses based on that and on local government tax breaks and figure theyll make up the expenses and then some from indirect and induced spending that results from the event in the case of the final four the state agreed to pay up to 61 million if the expenses were approved and if the local governments would put up 973000 and they figured the state would bring in about twice that amount in taxes on spending associated with the event  money that wouldnt be spent they figure if the final four had gone to another state texas already won the 2011 super bowl but theres a move to expand the tax breaks to include eventrelated spending over a longer period of time andor to include benefits from nondirect spending say the economists broaden their economic impact study to cover more than a twoweek window or to include indirect and induced spending in their numbers either would make more money available to the locals for reimbursement combs says they might be able to add to their event planning as a result and bring more money into state coffers as a result its an incentive  not a subsidy she says its a net moneymaker  utility regulators are considering a deal that would cut 144 million from a subsidy paid to phone companies that provide service in highcost areas thats less than the 263 million in cuts proposed by the staff of the states public utility commission but all of the companies involved in the fight have signed off on it we wrote about the tentative deal last month the puc will get a chance to ratify it in a couple of weeks the socalled universal service fund is filled with a 44 percent tax on all phone bills the money goes to four companies that provide service in areas that were labeled highcost when the fund was created in the mid1990s right now its a 3949 million per year deal the new agreement would whittle that over four years time the four companies  att verizon embarq and windstream  asked for 755 million annually the puc staff recommended a total of 132 million per year this settlement puts the total at 2365 million  somewhere between the current amount and the staff proposal verizons subsidy would be cut to 69 million from 97 million att would be cut to 44 million from 160 million embarq and windstream would get 375 million and 86 million respectively as against 44 million and 94 million now the agreement doesnt specify when or by how much that 44 percent charge on phone bills should drop simply saying that it

A Fling or a Trend?	2008-03-10	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2008/03/10/a-fling-or-a-trend/	en	texas republicans have never had a primary like this one they got a quarter of a million more voters to the polls this year than they did in the presidential primaries four years ago and they werent the big story texas democrats havent voted in these numbers since the days when their primary was a de facto general election the last time more than two million people voted in a texas democratic primary was 1972  when the state had presidential and gubernatorial candidates on the same ticket this year  the first time texas was an important part of the primary map for democratic presidential candidates since the days of lbj  29 million people voted altogether the two parties followed their record early voting by turning out 4252386 voters  just under the number that voted in the 2006 general election that gave governor rick perry a second full term who are these people not everyone answers that the same way pollster daron shaw a political science prof at the university of texas at austin said 15 to 20 percent of the people voting in the democratic primary had some republican voting history so there was some crossover but he and others say it wasnt out of line with some past elections pollster mike baselice puts the number lower at 9 to 15 percent but sees some crossover another republican pollster bryan eppstein of fort worth puts that crossover number in the same range and thinks most of the new voters in the two primaries were borrowed from november theyre new to the primaries but not to the polls and he concludes that the turnout boom is a fling and not a trend  and that novembers numbers wont be as far out of line as the primary numbers were leland beatty a democratic numbercruncher was most interested in exit polling that showed women over 40 holding onto their share of the primary vote  46 to 48 percent  in spite of the growth in the number of voters they still made up more than twofifths of the vote just as they usually do and that helped hillary clinton stave off barack obama latinos also held onto their share of the democratic primary vote he says further bolstering clinton baselice says the hispanics came late partly accounting for the differences in early voting  obama won  and election day voting which went strongly toward clinton barack obama won the early voting in texas but lost that lead and then some on election day several things went right for hillary clinton and wrong for her rival  she successfully dominated the conversation during the last five days of the contest combining words on the trail and more importantly in the endlessly repeating news cycle on the internet cable and broadcast tv and radio and newspapers with her 3 am  commercials raising doubts about obamas experience  obama didnt close the deal opening a new front in this political war before locking things up in texas he was still battling with clinton when he began taking on republican john mccain had that worked wed all be talking about what a nice job of positioning hed done to move her out of the spotlight and convince voters it was a twoperson contest instead mccains response to obamas nudging reinforced clintons attacks on obamas experience  obama who was well behind clinton in most midfebruary polls appeared to catch up he narrowly won the states early vote but her strong close  and the fact that some of her voters waited until election day  put him away people who made their decisions in the last three days went her way 6436 percent according to exit polling thats with both candidates working the state but clinton and her gang running a particularly tough schedule she won in more than a dozen counties where hed taken the early vote more importantly she widened her margins in several counties where she led the early voting when the votes were tallied obama won in just 24 of the states 254 counties but that small number hides some big counties collin dallas denton fort bend harris tarrant and williamson one county coryell landed the tennis ball right on top of the net 2434 people voted for clinton and 2434 voted for obama according to the texas secretary of state clinton ended up winning in 15 counties where she was behind in early voting obama didnt flip any counties from her early vote win column to his side on election day and to improve her numbers at the end she had to win big on election day in fact she got 534 percent of that days vote her final overall number was 509 percent and even in counties where she ultimately lost she cut into obamas numbers a big fat example clinton only got 433 percent of the harris county vote but in early voting she got 374 percent and on election day she got 479 percent she lost the county and not by a little but that change brought almost 24000 votes into her column when all the votes were counted she beat obama by 101029 with almost a quarter of the margin attributable to the harris county turnaround between friday when early voting ended and tuesday when the polls opened for political business that happened on a smaller scale in counties across the state obama arguably ran a better race on the ground the answer to that will come officially at the end of the month when democratic county and senatorial district conventions produce the first solid look at delegate counts clinton won the delegates distributed by primary voting 6561 obamas supporters expect to win those distributed according to raucous caucuses held after the polls closed this week that second group is a better measure of the campaigns ground troops one observer  democratic numbers wiz leland beatty  said obama didnt go after that part of texas that is like kansas ignoring a huge swath of west texas that behaves politically like large sections of kansas where obama beat clinton in earlier contests another  republican pollster mike baselice  thought late voting by hispanics and other groups important to clinton helped turn the result gop pollster daron shaw says it might be simpler than that i think were overanalyzing this a little bit obama had his first bad week in months and that played in  john mccain and hillary clinton got the headlines incumbents had a pretty good night eight house incumbents were defeated and a ninth faces a runoff but legislators in both parties held off wellfinanced attacks and what about battle craddick  the fight over votes for house speaker tom craddick it was a mixed bag but by our

walle and former representative al edwards of houston each knocked off an incumbent respectively juan escobar paul moreno kevin bailey and borris miles making an issue of house speaker tom craddick turned out to be a nonstarter in most parts of the state both for opponents of the speaker and for people who argued that he needs more support this sort of thing can work former us house majority leader tom delay got blamed for some losses after he became politically radioactive but in this election craddick didnt set off the geiger counters in the same way among either opponents or supporters that wasnt the only good news for the speaker he picked up one or two votes on tuesday depending on how you count and on which candidate promises you think will last until the next election of a speaker in january 2009 eight house members got beat this week nine more who served during the last legislative session either resigned or decided not to seek reelection a number of legislators from both parties still face tough fights in november the short version is that the primaries didnt answer the question of wholl be speaker next session craddicks still in it but doesnt have anything locked up the speaker issue could heat up in the general election when democrats can be rallied against republican management and republicans can be rallied in favor of it and a new federal court ruling will let outsiders play in the speakers race  through political action committees and other guises  for the first time itll be tight no matter what there are 79 republicans and 71 democrats in the texas house right now when craddick won his first term breaking the centuryold democratic hold on the seat there were 88 republicans it takes 76 votes to become speaker and more support than that to comfortably hold that job tuesdays primary produced a handful of runoff races the drill early voting starts march 31 and runs for five days election day is april 8 five of the tiebreakers are for open statehouse seats ones an incumbent fighting for another term and one features the two survivors of a 10way contest for the chance to challenge an incumbent democratic congressman all of those contests are on the republican side   the democratic primary produced only one state race runoff mark thompson of hamilton didnt get quite enough votes to avoid another month of work in his bid for texas railroad commission now he faces a runoff with dale henry of lampasas who previously ran for that post as a republican henry if he makes it into the general election will be the first candidate to run against each of the three members of a sitting railroad commission hes already lost to victor carrillo and elizabeth ames jones republican michael williams is the incumbent seeking reelection this time   the herd of elephants in cd22 is down to two  dr shelley sekula gibbs with 297 percent of the primary votes and pete olson with 207 percent olson put out a press release calling for five debates with his opponent  one in each county in the district and one on a local radio station were going to start talking about something different  the specific issues olson said shelley thinks thats a brilliant idea said cb currier with the sekula gibbs campaign currier said theyd pull back from big media ads and focus on the small community of voters likely to stay in the game until april they have a lot of work to do said kevyn bazzy but in a way its easier because if you dont get a good vibe from a voter you can mark that one off and move on  bazzy who received less than two percent in the primary said olsons military experience has a chance of standing out now that the other military men  brian klock ryan rowley and bazzy himself  are out im excited for the voters that they have two good choices said jim squier who ended up with 18 percent on election day he wouldnt name a favorite its a doubleedged sword for sekula gibbs and olson a oneonone race is more intense but easier on candidates and voters  the two will try to win new support but wont have to do it from a tencandidate crowd sekula gibbs ran before losing a writein campaign to democrat nick lampson that and her shortbutturbulent tenure finishing tom delays term could draw institutional opposition to her from other politicians watch the endorsements   it was a tight race in hd52 where representative mike krusee rround rock decided not to seek reelection the work isnt done for prosecutor dee hobbs who got 318 percent and insurance executive bryan daniel with 30 percent john gordon was 83 votes behind with 292 percent and says he wont seek a recount there were three of us spending a lot of money and we were all three working real hard said gordon one of us three was going to come up short  he said he hasnt decided who hell endorse or even who has the best chance to win in april  but hes certain theyll throw in a lot of cash over the next few weeks hobbs and daniel seem to be friendly foes i wasnt sure what kind of campaign we were going to have hobbs said its been a very friendly race  im very pleased with the outcome said daniel im ready to move forward and i hope we continue to campaign on the issues  neither candidate is changing their campaign strategy both say its time to focus on keeping the voters energized for another round   martha tyroch and ralph sheffield have another month of campaigning ahead in hd55 she led with 361 percent he ended up with 311 percent after finishing with 204 percent mike pearce sent a personal thankyou to his supporters and said hell endorse sheffield he is a good man and we need him to win this race as the alternative would be deleterious to district 55 pearce said in the email it was very obvious that there would be a runoff and we were prepared said tyroch a former member of the temple city council we are ready im not tired at all  john alaniz who ended up with 124 percent said both candidates have asked for his endorsement but hes still wavering im not surprised at the outcome at the end of the day it was who had the most money alaniz said i think the two strongest conservatives were the two that had the least money  tyroch raised 145557 so far sheffield raised 69713 and loaned his campaign another 88546 they both spent a lot on ads and start round two with about equal standing   representative buddy west of odessa made his own pickle telling the full house at the end of last session that hed enjoyed his eight terms in office but that for health reasons he was moving on and wouldnt seek reelection by the time his health improved and his mind was changed the pickle was sour  hed attracted the attention of other republicans in hd81 now hes fighting for his life he finished second in a fourway race on tuesday with 384 percent  enough to make the runoff with frontrunning tryon lewis an attorney and former judge who won the support of 44 percent of the voters   angie chen button and randy dunning are headed for a runoff in the hd112 she led with 379 percent to his 35 percent jim shepherd wasnt that far behind with 271 percent it was a very nice campaign in the first round said buttons consultant craig murphy but dunning started attacking at the very end were not going to let him get away with that now  murphy said he thought shepherd was the stronger opponent but he just got a late start and didnt run a negative campaign its a classic runoff between someone whos got a proven conservative record and someone who does not said kevin brannon dunnings consultant that campaign is zeroing in on political contributions button a former dart board member made to dallas democrats including us representative eddie bernice johnson state representative terri hodge and senator royce west shepherd had the endorsement of incumbent fred hill  now shepherd is deciding who hell back for the runoff he said hes taking a few days to figure it out i know that an amazing amount of money will be spent over the next few weeks because a lot has already been spent shepherd said sidebar a local blog in the district suziblitzcom  backs dunning but they got pranked by an anonymous computer wiz who pasted ads against dunning all over their website thats been cured now they think   district 144 is heading for a runoff between ken legler and fred roberts legler led round one with 459 percent of the votes to roberts 395 percent john hughey got 146 percent incumbent robert talton ran unsuccessfully in cd22 and the statehouse seat is open hes backing roberts on a one to ten scale im a seven right now said roberts a pasadena school board trustee id be a ten if i won by 51 percent but i fell a little short  allen blakemore is consulting for legler a businessman who served on the texas commission on environmental quality and is now chairman of the epas national advisory board blakemore said roberts got a lot of the school crowd to the polls my attitude toward runoffs is turnout turnout turnout blakemore said its usually pretty low so youre back to the party faithful we know who our people are  legler has big business support pacs from chevron att and valero contributed to his campaign but the thirdplace finisher isnt a fan mr legler is totally unqualified hughey said i have a feeling hes not going to win hes a tool of the lobbies and they will spend a lot of money to try and get him elected  hes still deciding whether hell back roberts it all depends on how various people act in the upcoming days   by karie meltzer roland gutierrez was the only candidate who filed to run for the rest of representative robert puentes term in office making a formality of that special election hes also the only candidate on the ballot for a full term next fall unless something truly weird

Names, Trivia, and Money	2008-01-28	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2008/01/28/names-trivia-and-money/	en	the ballots are more or less complete pending court actions and dirty tricks and all the usual stuff and the annual courtship between the vampires and the blood banks  candidates and financiers  is well underway so we made some lists we merged the democratic republican and libertarian ballots and have those available online theres a ranking of the 100 biggest campaign cash balances and the complete 2400 line list of everybody with a campaign account available here for download if youre into heavy research all of that stuff is available in the files section of our website but first some statistics starting with congress then the state senate and then the state house  only three congressional incumbents face primary opposition and those three also have contested races ahead in november six members of the delegation have thirdparty candidates and nothing else on the fight card this year 22 members of the delegation  11 from each party  have major party opponents in november us representative louie gohmert rtyler is the only member of the delegation who got a free ride this year  three state senators have primary opponents and only one of those  judith zaffirini dlaredo  also has major party opposition in november six senators have third party opposition in november and nothing else ahead five senators have major party opposition in november but nothing until then two will be done with competition once their primaries are over whether they win or lose only one state senator  eddie lucio jr dbrownsville  got a free ride  23 members of the texas house 7 republicans 16 democrats dont have any opponents all year and another 38 26 republican 12 democrat face only thirdparty opposition before the next legislative session eight house races will be decided in march with the winner there sailing through november a dozen members face opposition in march and in november there are 29 primaries on the house ballots 17 republicans 13 democrats with primaries on both sides in el pasos hd78 and 52 members of the house 24 republicans 28 democrats wont face an opponent until november tom annunziato claimed residence in parker county when he filed libel and defamation lawsuits against eye doctors in florida georgia and new york two years ago he claimed to live in tarrant county when he filed to run for the legislature last month but he never moved and in all of those documents the same street address is used only the city and county change the fort worth optometrist says his lawyer made the mistake in the court filings  an error that had the effect of moving the venue of those cases from tarrant county where he lives to parker county where his lawyer lives and practices annunziatos lawyer is representative phil king rweatherford in his application for a spot on the gop ballot in this years elections annunziato signed an application saying hes been a texas resident for 35 years a tarrant county resident for 15 years and a resident of house district 99 for eight years thats undisputed even his opponent in hd99  representative charlie geren rfort worth  says annunziato lives in the district geren said he wont challenge annunziatos residency on the basis of the court papers i wouldnt attempt to challenge that  i know he lives in tarrant county and i know he lives in fort worth geren said but im very disappointed that he would lie to a district court  in the three lawsuits he filed two years ago against the ophthalmologists annunziatos lawyer king listed parker county as his residential address in his pleadings and in a standard boilerplate the pleading said venue in parker county is proper in this cause under the mandatory venue provision for libel and slander actions as the plaintiff resides in parker county  annunziato said he lives in fort worth and in tarrant county though he adds that the mail for his neighborhood goes through the post office in aledo on the other side of the county line in fact the tarrant appraisal district lists the property as a fort worth address but has an aledo mailing address for the taxpayer they dont list it anywhere as a parker county property the parker county appraisal district lists two unimproved properties owned in part by annunziato but both are in weatherford annunziato has a business address in weatherford but filed the suit as an individual had he listed a tarrant county address the case wouldnt have gone to lawyer kings home court in weatherford but to one of several courts in fort worth instead annunziato was suing the eye doctors for their comments about an advertisement that showed him wearing surgical scrubs optometrists dont go to medical school arent doctors and cant operate on people he says he wasnt suing them for being ophthalmologists taunting an optometrist but because of the personal nature of the attacks and the phrases they used i would have sued these guys if they were auto mechanics he says he sued dr mark anthony johnson of venice florida for 75000 in november 2005 johnson started a string of comments on the website with a withering post about annunziatos garb titled were all the cowboy costumes taken  annunziato sued dr david gerstenfeld of staten island new york for 75000 for responding to johnsons comments on a website by writing amen brother  and he sued dr richard schulze jr of savannah georgia for his responses to the post as with the other two lawsuits annunziato sought 75000 in damages all three cases were settled in 2006 and dismissed king and annunziato said all three defendants agreed to pay attorney fees and to write letters of apology did it matter where the cases landed two of the defense lawyers in the cases  dan barrett of fort worth and carlos balido of dallas  didnt return calls and yes thats the same dan barrett elected last month to finish anna mowerys term in the texas house stephen marsh of richardson who represented schulze contested the jurisdiction of the case but not the venue before settling he didnt think the interstate claim belonged in a texas court he didnt know about the venue problem but when told of it he said the weatherford court that took the case was fair in my case it didnt matter he said the judge was pretty straight  geren wasnt as nice about it sounds to me like phil was trying to get it to his home county he said they both know annunziatos home is in tarrant county  king is also annunziatos business lawyer and in earlier lawsuits noted his clients business addresses in fort worth and in weatherford and also that he resides in fort worth tarrant county texas  king initially didnt remember why the case was filed in parker county but said a staff lawyer who drafted the cases for him was confused about the aledo mailing address for annunziato and other residents of his neighborhood i certainly wanted to keep the business in parker county he said i prefer to do that because its a mile to the courthouse instead of 25 miles  after doing some checking king said he had the option of filing in either county the suit could have gone to tarrant county where tom actually resides or in weatherford where the harm occurred he said venue in libel cases has to be set in either the county where the plaintiff resided or the county where the defendant resided since none of the defendants lived in texas that would be tarrant county but king said the comments that set off the lawsuits were brought to annunziatos attention by a weatherford ophthalmologist you can file where you live or where the harm occurred king said and he added it didnt come up at the time there was never an objection he said wendy davis can stay on the ballot against senator kim brimer after a fort worth appeals court threw out a case filed by three firefighters the three firefighters sued to take davis a democrat and former fort worth city councilwoman off the ballot saying she signed up to run for the new job before she was off the council but after a short hearing the fort worth startelegram has the blowbyblow here the threejudge panel from the states 2nd court of appeals said the three didnt have standing to sue and tossed out the case without reaching the issue of her eligibility rob gibson a spokesman for the firefighters said theyre still deciding whether to appeal the case to the texas supreme court and said the case has now been rejected twice without any decision on its merits the issue of her davis eligibility is still out there he said the courts have dismissed this twice on technicalities my guys are worried that theyll get to november without an eligible candidate thats what theyre trying to avoid  the group originally filed the case with the texas supreme court which rejected the case and said it should be filed instead with the lower appellate court that courts the one that ruled against the firefighters a ruling that could be appealed back to the supremes the firefighters filed the suit as individuals who live in the senate district but they have ties to brimer the fort worthbased eppstein group helped the firefighters pass a ballot initiative in november that firm is also the political consultant to the incumbent davis wants to challenge the mails flying out there in election land and not just the stuff with the pretty pictures and the red white and blue color schemes  take this letter from representative trey martinez fischer dsan antonio to his colleagues in the house democratic caucus hes taking up for a couple of democratic incumbents being challenged in the primaries and at the lobbyists helping them a sample short and sweet  any lobbyist who targets juan escobar juan garcia or any member of our democratic caucus is targeting me and every one of you like you i find it more than coincidental that one lobbying firm has taken such an open and hostile position against the democratic caucus  he doesnt name the lobby firm and he didnt mention a number of democratic incumbents who are being challenged for backing republican house speaker tom craddick some of their opponents were drafted by other members of the hdc fischer ends with a pitch for donations for escobar whos being challenged in the democratic primary by tara rios ybarra of south padre island garcia has a tough race ahead in november but no opposition in march  or this one from senator dan patrick rhouston whos trying to knock off one of the republican house members whose district overlaps his own patricks backing allen fletcher the challenger to representative corbin van arsdale rtomball and laid out his case in a fivepage letter mailed into that house district van arsdale says hell have a response going to voters in the next few days meanwhile those two are tussling over a radio ad patricks a radio host at ksev in houston and van arsdale is running spots on that station they feature people saying theyre supporters of patrick and van arsdale  an email got us going on this one tom glass of houston sent a note to firearms freedom friends saying hell be holding a funder for randy dunning whos running for an open house seat in northeast dallas county guests at that shindig will include senator dan patrick rhouston and harris county tax assessorcollector paul bettencourt among others patrick bettencourt and dallas lawyer tom pauken who headed governor rick perrys unsuccessful push to limit property tax growth are backing dunning because of who hes not hes not fred hill and hes not fred hills candidate in the race hill is the outgoing state representative and the leader of the successful fight against the property tax limits his argument then and now was that the caps on local revenue would limit cities and counties that were simultaneously forced to cover the costs of state mandates and theres the argument that state officials were trying to do to local officials what they havent been able to do to themselves in limiting spending growth anyhow hills for jim shepherd a former member of both the richardson city council and the richardson isd board state representative ismael kino flores dpalmview reported two 10000 loans  made in december two weeks apart  in his most recent campaign finance filings whats unusual is that they werent loans to the campaign they were loans from the campaign but they dont list the borrower which could have been anyone from the candidate his own self to spongebob squarepants flores didnt return our calls seeking explanation  candidates who get an endorsement from the texas medical association and the texas academy of family physicians get an internet commercial in the bargain that trade group has endorsed five incumbents so far and posted commercials for them on its website each has a local doctor opening and closing the spot with the middle of the donut filled with pictures and a narrative of legislation backed by the candidate that was good for the medical community the first five senator judith zaffirini dlaredo and representatives betty brown rterrell dawnna dukes daustin charlie geren rfort worth and vicki truitt rkeller  tom annunziato owes it all to his fellow optometrists at least in terms of campaign finance the fort worth optometrists first campaign finance report says he raised 178265 during the second half of 2007 the biggest contributor as weve reported previously was the texas optometric pac which gave him 75000 and also did 2955 in mailings on his behalf but individuals in his business were just as active if you crack open his report and total the contributions from people who list their occupation as optometrists youll find another 77700 throw out the people in the eye business and he raised only 22610  it wont affect this years elections in texas except perhaps as an issue but the debate over picture identification of voters is in full swing interim committees are holding hearings and interest groups and legislators are staging press events the topper the democratic lone star project financed a minidocumentary on senator mario gallegos

supreme court refused to hear his case against the state partys loyalty oath  kucinich refused to swear hed vote for the partys nominee in november a condition the texas democratic party puts on its

turned him away and a federal judge in austin ruled that the democrats were within their rights the ohio congressman appealed all the way up to the supremes but they refused without comment to hear his complaint transportation officials got some splaining to do in the coming month say legislators concerned about the texas department of transportations postponement of more than 50 construction projects throughout the state simply put txdot cant build new projects because the agency is flat broke according to house transportation chair mike krusee rround rock who says anyone whos been paying attention to the agency should already understand that senate transportation chair john carona rdallas puts the blame on the board that runs txdot its really easy to direct the woes between the legislature and transportation to txdot when in reality the finger has to be pointed at the texas transportation commission its the very definition of a rogue effort he says we just cant blindly put money any longer into txdot and expect that the good things and the right things will happen  according to information from txdot 54 projects in 28 counties  ranging from construction of curbs and gutters to the building of interstate interchanges  wont begin until at least the end of august estimated costs range from 346000 for landscaping along ih20 in harris county to 181 million for a tollway interchange with ih30 in dallas the total tab is 116 billion if we are able to identify other funds later in the year if gas tax revenues take off or there is some other influx of money available we may try to bring some of these projects back on the books says christopher lippincott a txdot spokesman but theres no promise of that so communities are being asked to brace themselves for this to be the list  carona calls the decision to delay the projects part of a political agenda that is very illtimed and we intend beginning on feb 5 to get to the bottom of it  you might be watching presidential results on that super tuesday but the transportationminded will be birddogging txdot and its governing board first thing that morning the senate committee on transportation and homeland security will convene for its regular quarterly meeting theyll be joined an hour later by the senate finance committee for a joint session and that afternoon the legislative study committee on private participation in toll projects meets for the first time the senators want to hear why txdot and ttc are freezing the projects its not as simple as is txdot running out of money but thats one of the big questions that comes up says committee director stephen polunsky in the afternoon the legislative study committee authorized by senate bill 792 the toll road moratorium bill will hold its first meeting with the idea of producing a report by the next legislative session the study committee comprises sens carona robert nichols rjacksonville and tommy williams rthe woodlands representatives larry phillips rsherman aaron pea dedinburg and wayne smith rbaytown and public appointees john johnson of houston like senator nichols a former ttc commissioner robert poole of florida the reason foundations director of transportation studies and grady smith of duncanville secretary of the dallas regional mobility coalition setting the stage for those hearings are a pair of federal transportation reports and a ttc commissioners meeting taking place in victoria next week the first since the death of ttc chair ric williamson the first federal report from the national surface transportation policy and revenue study commission spurred criticism by governor rick perry and others for its recommendations to raise gas taxes and give the feds more control of transportation infrastructure planning a second federal report  a preliminary one  is also coming within a week this one from the national surface transportation infrastructure financing commission says krusee whos a member of the commission krusee says the first report dealt with how to fix existing problems with and meet future demands of the nations transportation infrastructure his commission is charged with figuring out how to pay for it the first report was widely declared doa says krusee due to its proposal for gasoline tax hikes no legislature is going to vote for that  the second wont push for higher gas taxes he says but will include a proposal to tax automobiles according to mileage this is called vehiclemilestraveled or vmt providing backdrop for the feb 5 meetings is an ongoing inquiry into txdot by the sunset advisory commission the lege doesnt meet until next year of course but new sunset member senator glenn hegar rkaty says the commission should have some types of recommendations about txdot soon  by say april  hegars main concern entering into the sunset study is that if txdot is as broke as it claims to be why didnt it come out during a legislative session in which transportation was a major topic i dont see how we could be broke today in this form or fashion hegar says in several years i see a longterm potential problem i dont see how all of a sudden these decisions to delay projects need to be made today  txdot has done a pretty god job convincing everyone that the sky is falling and you better do what we say says state representative joe pickett del paso a frequent critic of the agency but its just not working its just not working  pickett says that txdot has brought in about 500 to 600 million above its estimated budget for each of the past five or six years and he wont buy into txdots postulations of penury until they show him where the money went all 3 billion of it one of picketts assertions is that txdot might be engaging in accounting sleights of hand by shifting money for construction projects into the morelooselyaudited maintenance account the timing of the decision to go from construction to maintenance is very suspect concurs carona i think that knowing what i know today i would agree with that characterization  but carona doesnt wholly agree with picketts assertion that txdot has money coming out of their ears  on that point caronas in line with hegar i do believe that fundamentally we have a shortage of funding fundamentally its the job of the legislature to fix that carona says what is happening in the ttc is so many of its policies have been politically driven with an agenda toward the privatization of roadways and they use every opportunity to speak out on the shortage of funds and on occasion they create those opportunities  he says committee members are not going to browbeat txdot officials and ttc commissioners at next months meeting but they will ask them to explain some things to wit one why they have the cashflow problems that they do two why they chose at this particular time to move funds from road construction to maintenance three well ask specifically for the steps needed from the legislature to correct the problem  what is not an acceptable answer will be any recommendation for further publicprivate partnerships carona says a few things everyone except pickett agrees upon is that txdots financial troubles stem from multiple causes including high rates of inflation lowerthanexpected receipts from the federal government and diversion of highway money in fund 6 to nonhighwayrelated projects about 15 billion in highway money will be spent on other priorities during the 200809 biennium says lippincott estimating txdots annual budget will run a little more than 8 billion per year add sb 792 to the list of reasons for txdots fiscal woes says krusee because the law takes away the agencys ability to obtain private financing which it was banking on in order to build new roads they absolutely are running out of money and i hope the sunset will serve to better educate the members he says they state lawmakers decided to take a pause and so this is the consequences krusee says pickett is skeptical there needs to be a complete wholesale cleaning normally sunset would be the time for that i dont see it happening  by patrick brendel some say a change in state law allowing racetrack owners to have interest in three not just two tracks is no more than a tiny glimmer of hope for the gaming industry but with primaries not far off even that quiet legislation  brought to the fore by the houston chronicle  could mean the gaming interests will start pushing further a lobbyist in the middle of it says things are developing and moving forward with the elections in mind but it doesnt seem like anything new those in the horse and dogracing world still want to bring vlts video lottery terminals to the tracks those in the gaming world still want to

eddie lucio dbrownsville calls expanding gaming in texas like the guy who cried wolf they just know it doesnt happen you get their hopes up and they get nothing   by karie meltzer at the request of harris county prosecutors a houston court dropped the indictments against texas supreme court justice david medina and his wife and later the charges were nullified when a judge found the grand jury had been improperly held over and didnt as a matter of law have the power to indict a ham sandwich much less a supreme court justice the indictments were handed up by a harris county grand jury after prosecutors took it to them but harris county district attorney chuck rosenthal and his staff decided they didnt have enough evidence to indict and went to court to get the charges dropped the lawyer for mrs medina terry yates filed suit against two grand jury members who went public with their disgust over rosenthals decision yates wanted them held in contempt for talking to reporters about a case thats still open the jurors told the houston chronicle and the quorum report that theyll consider reindicting the medinas over the objections of the das office but when the judge said the grand jury wasnt in office yates had no grounds to sue the charges stem from a fire at the medinas home in spring last summer that investigators suspect was intentionally started the grand jury accused

Crash Test Dummies	2007-11-12	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2007/11/12/crash-test-dummies/	en	dan barrett and mark shelton  a lawyer and a doctor a democrat and a republican an opponent and a supporter of the current speaker of the house  will face each other in a runoff in hd97 in a few weeks the money is big the stakes are big and theres nothing else going on in state politics at the moment its a petri dish full of whatll be happening in house races for the next 12 months barrett a democrat led a sevenman pack of candidates in the special election to replace representative anna mowery rfort worth he got 315 percent of the vote next was shelton who got 229 percent followed by former representative bob leonard with 186 percent and craig goldman with 167 percent three others  jeff humber chris hatch and james schull  brought up the rear barrett who ran an unsuccessful challenge against mowery last year will have to make up some ground to win a primary republicans got 685 percent of the vote on tuesday while he didnt have to share his base vote with anyone hell have to get the rest of what he needs from new voters or from people who voted for a republican in the first round keeping score at home barrett would vote against another term for house speaker tom craddick and shelton would vote for the speaker round one featured some election day shenanigans somebody  there are theories but no hard evidence yet  paid for professional phone calls that said in essence that the goldman campaign had turned up some dirt on leonards voting record in the 1980s they were after him about a tax bill he supported voting with leonard ironically was representative tom craddick  now the speaker and republican governor bill clements was on board too we heard a tape of the calls which sounded like a radio commercial played over the phone there was no disclaimer and the only two candidate names in the piece were the two supposed frontrunners goldman sent a note to supporters in the middle of the day disavowing the calls and youll find some talk that the calls pulled leonard down  he made those votes see  and then pulled goldman down for what appeared to be a late hit from his campaign they finished 753 and 1100 votes out of the running respectively the austin money had goldman in craddicks corner and vice versa but shelton is also a procraddick provoucher republican and has the support of his fellow doctors besides the other prevailing theory of the upset  we use that term loosely to mean that the people in austin didnt see what was coming in fort worth or in many cases that voters were talking about immigration and not the race for speaker  is that shelton outworked his rivals he hit the streets other doctors and their families and friends hit the streets shelton has been more involved in recent republican politics in fort worth than either leonard or goldman those two have wellknown names and more money but shelton had a better ground game by some accounts the biggest money in sheltons campaign was sheltons he had 50000 in outstanding loans to himself when his last report was filed a week before the election the pac affiliated with the texas medical association was next with 10000 in the race goldman had a number of large contributors including his old boss former us senator phil gramm who gave individually and through his pac and the late angel in leonards campaign was hebs charles butt of san antonio who gave 25000 in the last week the winner ran one of the cheaper campaigns spending just a little more than the guy in fifth place and if youre doing an efficiency study well just look at this chart this charts been corrected to account for a reporting error made by the leonard campaign look here for details about that   election officials in fort worth are hoping the guv will put the hd97 runoff on december 11 to match up with the city runoff elections the governor cant officially set a date until after the votes are canvassed  probably next week  and then has a 20 to 45day window within which to hold an election that city election features a runoff between two democrats and theres a significant overlap between the districts the house district is on the redder edge of purple  its republican for the most part  but if the elections are on the same day theres a chance the democrats would be more motivated each of the 16 constitutional amendments on the ballot passed easily on tuesday the headlines went to the 3 billion bond issue for cancer research but voters also approved 675 billion in bonds for transportation state buildings and parks water projects in the colonias and college loans for students they approved homestead exemptions for veterans  that got 91 percent of the vote  and limits on appraisal increases for themselves they struck inspectors of hides from the state constitution and gave the legislature permission to give tax breaks to people who use their cars in their work governments can sell property acquired through eminent domain back to the original owners for the original price and voters cleared up some murky practices in the home equity loan business the second most popular measure  it got 845 percent of the vote  requires the state to post final votes on legislative issues on the internet texans also overwhelmingly voted to allow the state to deny bail to people with repeated family violence offenses old judges will be able to serve out their terms if they turn 75  the retirement age  while in office we found some interesting lint in the election numbers only five amendments won approval in each of the states 254 counties only one proposed amendment  a 1 billion bond issue for state construction and maintenance projects  got less than 60 percent of the vote it got 582 percent the least friendly place for changes to the constitution was in loving county where 15 people voted and where 11 of the 16 amendments went down in flames only one person there voted for construction bonds only two voted for transportation bonds four amendments had trouble in 60 or more counties prop 4 with its 1 billion in bonds for construction repair and maintenance of state buildings and parks lost in 111 counties some relatively big counties  williamson smith and galveston  were among the naysayers prop 12  5 billion for transportation bonds  lost in 64 counties though no big populations were in that bunch and props 15 and 16  3 billion in cancer bonds and 250 million in water development bonds for economically distressed areas  were unpopular in 60 and 66 counties respectively williamson lubbock and smith counties said no to the cancer bonds smith midland and lubbock counties were in the no column on water development bonds turnout was miserable the highwater mark was on prop 15 which attracted 1088252 voters or 865 percent of the registered voters dont laugh too hard at the turnout in loving county it was only 15 people sure but that was 133 percent turnout they outdid the state looking for a noisy and expensive political brawl consider the challenge to senator mike jackson rla porte jackson a state lawmaker since 1988 faces his first real fight in a decade if he has his druthers then voters will be thinking of windstorm insurance and the margins tax two issues hell campaign on if challenger joe jaworski dgalveston gets his way voters will be talking about jacksons support from special interests like insurance refining and electricity i think jaworski will be a serious candidate says heber taylor editor of the galveston county daily news i think he will i know hell try to raise more than a million dollars for this race and from what ive heard hes already gotten a sizeable portion of that  taylors got a hometown interest jaworski is a partner in the jaworski law firm and from 2000 to 2006 he served on the galveston city council stepping down due to term limits as of july 15 jaworski had a little more than 200000 on hand after steady fundraising including a recent event at the westgate towers in austin jaworski estimates hes now got about 350000 in his account his target is to raise between 1 million and 15 million on the campaign by comparison jackson had about 900000 on hand in july we will be working to raise at a bare minimum an additional million says lee woods jacksons general campaign consultant jackson is seeking his third reelection to the senate and he hasnt had to run a serious senate race since his first victory over democrat edward wesley in 1998 jackson was in the house for ten years before running for the senate woods says theyre putting together the infrastructure of the reelection campaign which they plan to get in place by the end of the year by january were going to begin an aggressive campaign pretty much at all levels he says well keep the drumbeat very active and alive until the first tuesday in november 2008  taylor the editor says of jackson most people here who consider him involved in local issues will probably mention his support of coastal residents on windstorm insurance thats what he would be best known for  woods says jacksons campaign will revolve around the aforementioned windstorm insurance as well as the senators so far unsuccessful efforts to mitigate the effects of the margins tax on small business owners jackson himself owns an industrial construction firm the campaign will also stress jacksons involvement in the 135 million beach restoration project announced at the end of october by land commissioner jerry patterson taylors not sold on the beach project influencing voters though he says one item on the local ballot this week was an increase in the sales tax for economic development including raising money for beach renourishment projects that proposition failed by the widest margin taylor says im not so sure even if that is a card in somebodys hand im not sure what its worth  for now jacksons focused on meeting with groups within the district and updating them on the last legislative session says woods in addition to concentrating on his business jaworskis main issue he says is restoring confidence in government through leadership honesty and transparency  second and third respectively are advocating for strong laws to clean up our air and standing strong for my constituents against deregulated forprofit special interests like insurance electricity etc  jackson according to the challenger has a record of voting on an industrial and corporate platform specifically insurance and refinery interests within the district he says those are good things but adds they shouldnt get the nod every time over causes like clean air and reasonable insurance regulation thats not inline with the district according to woods there is a greater concentration of petrochemical companies in senate district 11 than in any kind of senate district or legislative district in the nation he says they are huge economic drivers for the senate district and the nation if mr jaworski thinks its out of place for senator jackson to be supported by employees and companies that he represents then ill let him take a stab at that  jaworski though says he will speak for constituents whom he says jackson has failed to represent people are not happy at utmb the university of texasmedical branch he says 80 to 90 percent of utmbs 12000 employees live in sd11 and havent been able to rely on their own guy in austin mike wont stand up for them and represent them and help them he says other senators have had to stand up thats one of the reasons that doctors are helping me to see someone actually be their advocate  jaworski says the district comprising a portion of galveston island the southeastern suburbs of houston and the city of angleton in brazoria county has voters who in the past were willing to elect a reasonable democratic candidate and he thinks he can attract independent and moderate republican backers woods is skeptical saying 615 percent of sd11 voters went for statewide gop candidates mr jaworski seems to be fairly energized about this campaign and thats all fine and good but numerically speaking were starting from a substantial advantage he says jaworski thinks voters are ready for someone new its a change election like none other he says since 1980  thats when i first started voting  theres been a shift in peoples tolerances as to how much more of the status quo they are going to take now is a time when a fresh serious candidate can get a fair hearing in this state  taylor is picking up the same scent in the sea breeze maybe one of the things jaworskis got going for him is there is a lot of is there a lot of sentiment just for change im not saying just a change of parties  its much more complicated than that its a desire for some type of change of direction whether that helps him or not i dont know its a little bit early to tell i expect this will be a serious race  before jaworski can swing at jackson hes got to secure the democratic nomination opposing him is nasa contractor bryan hermann who describes himself as one of the average people whose top three issues are education auto insurance and frivolous lawsuits hermann says it is a misinterpretation of the law to allow undocumented immigrants to attend state public schools and he thinks school funding problems could be addressed in part by denying educational services to those whose parents dont pay taxes he says texas should require insurance companies to notify the state whenever a person drops their car insurance coverage hermann says that guaranteeing that everyone with a drivers license has valid insurance will in the long run help to reduce insurance rates also hermann wants to make sure that lawsuits belonging in small claims court start in small claims court rather than dragging out for years and taking up court space and tax dollars hermann who lives in nassau bay has never run for office before but he says its supposed to be representation by the people for the people i do believe that i can represent the district accurately  he says that jaworski is being funded by people who live outside of the district and questions where jaworskis loyalties would lie if he becomes a senator joes a nice guy i dont have any personal issues with him i dont believe hes running for the right issues but thats his choice hermann says and he says he has challenged jaworski to a series of debates within the district and that jaworskis response was absolutely not  jaworski though says that he did accept hermanns offer to debate but that hermanns choice of location was sugar land which isnt in the senate district i have not heard back from him since jaworski says  by patrick brendel  the new candidate list includes robert bobby vickery of frost wholl run in the republican primary against representative byron cook rcorsicana in hd8 vickery says in an email note that hes running because i believe that we need a change and didnt offer many other details we asked about issues and financing and house management and such but said hell be organized and talking soon hes

Death and Texas	2007-10-15	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2007/10/15/death-and-texas/	en	the states top criminal judge has inspired a parody website and a complaint from a group of lawyers thats dead serious texas voters reelected sharon keller last year for another sixyear term as presiding judge of the texas court of criminal appeals that panels got the same juice as the texas supreme court only on the criminal side of the law and its become a lightning rod since keller told lawyers for michael richards last month that she wouldnt keep the office open past five oclock to receive their legal briefs with no legal papers in the works richards was executed that evening keller apparently did that without asking her fellow judges who contributed some of the most damning quotes in the news accounts that followed keller has also inspired a parody website  sharonkillercom which includes links to among other things a parody myspace page and something more serious too now a group of prominent and notso prominent defense lawyers is after her hide sending a letter to the state commission on judicial conduct that says her actions violated the judicial canons by denying a condemned man an appeal to which he was entitled judge kellers actions denied michael richard two constitutional rights access to the courts and due process which led to his execution her actions also brought the integrity of the texas judiciary and of her court into disrepute and was a source of scandal to the citizens of the state they wrote the complaint was filed by the texas civil rights project in their press release announcing it they said it was signed by a group that includes former state bar president broadus spivey houston criminal defense attorney dick deguerin university of houston law professor mike olivas former appellate judge michol oconnor legal ethics author chuck herring representative harold dutton dhouston southern methodist law school clinical supervisor eliot shavin and former nueces county attorney mike westergren the last time that agency tangled with an appellate judge  supreme court justice nathan hecht  he fought them in court and won the state has 15 billion more in its general revenue account than predicted according to comptroller susan combs thats on top of 7 billion she forecasted earlier this year in a letter to the governor and legislative leaders the comptroller said the state ended the year with an 85 billion balance in gr at the beginning of the year combs projected a balance of 7 billion the state brought in more tax money than she expected and spent less she said her in letter state sales taxes  the backbone of texas state finance  increased by 109 percent over the fiscal 2006 mark combs said the states rainy day fund officially the economic stabilization fund will total 46 billion when she makes a required deposit later this year experts whove been watching werent surprised at the final balance but cant quite put their fingers on the reason the states economy is acting this way whatever the reason they say its good news it means the state has some wiggle room says dale craymer economist with the texas taxpayer and research association if the margin tax doesnt make its estimate next year legislators will have some room  the states new business tax  sold as a way to pay for cuts in local property taxes  is due for the first time next may both the comptroller and legislative numbercrunchers say the local tax cuts will cost more than the new tax will bring in lawmakers with an eye on that kept their mitts off billions that were available for current spending last session as a hedge against those projections even if the moneys not needed for that there are other things to worry about this could give us a bigger cushion as a state than other states will have if the economy tanks craymer says thered be less chance of a tax increase  the size of the treasure chest already made it possible to certify a pay raise for state employees two percent in the current fiscal year two percent in the next one totaling 2427 million a spokesman for combs said lawmakers also appropriated about 300 million for transportation contingent on the comptrollers certification that the money will be there it will be representative carl isett rlubbock will head the sunset advisory commission for the next two years

The Final Push: A Special Session Update 	2011-06-28	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2011/06/28/the-final-push-a-special-session-update-/	en	the special session is down to the wire lawmakers must wrap up on wednesday with a few outstanding priorities left to tackle over the last several days measures have moved like traffic  at times speeding through at others stuck in a perpetual stop and go governor rick perry has sole discretion over the special session agenda and hes put a variety of topics on it from somewhat mundane fiscal bills needed to balance the budget to emotional issues like prohibiting sanctuary cities and hb 41 an antigroping bill aimed at the transportation security administration two bills stand in the way of final adjournment sb 1 which contains the school finance plan and hb 3 the bill to reform the claims process for twia the states insurer of last resort heres a rundown of where the texas legislature stands going into the secondtolast day of the special session  fiscal matters  these are bills lawmakers have to pass to balance the budget and carry out the spending cuts in house bill 1 the state budget for 20122013 bill sb 1 contains the school finance plan for distributing the 4 billion in cuts to districts statewide several payment deferrals and tax accelerations the bill is expected to generate 35 billion in revenue debate in the house started june 9 and lasted for 16 hours status passed the house and the senate currently in conference committee and scheduled for debate in the house on tuesday june 28 what to watch for the bill contains a provision to require online retailers to collect sales taxes if they do business in texas and directly or indirectly have physical locations in the state like amazoncom perry warned against this and vetoed a similar bill hb 2403 during the regular session lawmakers responded during the special session by attaching it to sb 1 as an amendment the budget conferees could decide to strip the measure or perry could veto the entire bill last week amazon offered to invest 300 million in five or six warehouse and distribution centers in the state employing 6000 people if lawmakers would let the company operate for fourandahalf years without collecting sales taxes from its customers lawmakers arent buying it as of monday afternoon sb1s sponsor in the house appropriations chair jim pitts rwaxahachie told the tribune that amazons tax break is not in the bill and the governor has not approached him about the issue while perry could veto anything he disagrees with pitts said he believes the provision represents the will of both the house and the senate bill sb 2 is another fiscal matters bill needed to balance the state budget for the next biennium democratic state representative donna howard initially tacked on an amendment to direct any surplus in the rainy day fund to enrollment growth in texas schools which are underfunded by 4 billion in this budget according to some estimates that rainy day surplus could be more than 2 billion with an improving economic climate but her proposal died after republicans instructed budget negotiators to strip it out of the final conference committee report status the house and the senate passed the conference committee report for sb 2 without howards amendment on monday its now headed to the governors desk what to watch for on the floor howard told the house that killing her amendment is shortsighted because the rainy day fund is generating more money than anticipated she warned lawmakers they would have to own up to cutting education by billions when we had money in the bank  during debate in the senate finance chair steve ogden rbryan said he had worked to keep the measure in the bill by putting a 700 million cap on it but negotiators from the lower chamber wouldnt budge education bill sb 6 is an education bill that broadens the way districts can use funding for textbooks status on monday the house and senate voted to adopt the conference committee report it now awaits the governors signature what to watch for when sb 6 passed the house it contained house public education chair rob eisslers testing bill from the regular session hb 500 which permits districts to set their own policies about how new endofcourse staar exams count toward a students final grade his counterpart in the senate senator florence shapiro rplano opposed the measure in the end shapiro won bill sb 8 is a comprehensive mandate relief measure that allows school districts to furlough teachers reduces contract termination notification and minimum salary requirements and expands the texas education agencys authority to grant waivers for the 221 student teacher size ratio status the bills conference committee report was approved by the house and senate on monday what to watch for sb 8 passed the house but not without a fierce debate from democrats and a smattering of no votes from a broad spectrum of republicans eissler said the bill would allow district officials to lower teacher pay and save jobs  state representative sylvester turner dhouston fired back by telling the chamber the bill is overkill  ive not heard from one teacher who has applauded us for doing this he said freshman state representative lance gooden a republican from terrell who was elected to office by tea party voters said my superintendents told me that teachers have taken enough of a beating this session while some of the tools in sb 8 would be nice for them they didnt think it was worth a vote against the teachers  it passed anyway by a vote of 8063 in the upper chamber debate was limited the bill passed with a 19 to 11 vote health care  bill sb 7 is an omnibus health care bill designed to save the state more than 400 million over the 20122013 biennium the bill aims to make medicaid more costeffective allow doctors to partner with hospitals and other health care groups to reach better outcomes and expand medicaid managed care into the rio grande valley status the house and senate passed the conference committee report for sb 7 on monday the measure now heads to governor rick perry for a signature what to watch for sb 7 is a fan favorite for abortion opponents because it includes amendments aimed at taking more family planning dollars away from outfits like planned parenthood and barring hospital districts that use tax revenue to finance an abortion from getting state funding except in the case of a medical emergency the measure is also home to two bills designed by representative lois kolkhorst rbrenham to give texas more control over medicaid and medicare the first is a health care compact which would allow texas to partner with other states to ask the federal government for control  both fiscal and governmental  over both medicare and medicaid the second is a measure that directs state officials to seek a waiver from washington to operate medicaid with a federal block grant neither measure is likely to gain the support of the obama administration bill hb 5 would allow texas to join with other states in a socalled health care compact in which state leaders would ask congress to grant them control of the purse strings and authority to operate medicare and medicaid status the bill passed the house and its been tacked on as an amendment to the previously mentioned sb 7 it is now headed to the governors desk what to watch for though georgia and oklahoma have passed similar legislation such a compact would likely face an uphill battle in washington dc bill hb 13 would allow texas to petition the obama administration for a block grant to operate the medicaid program which insures poor children the disabled and impoverished adults status the measure passed the house and its been tacked on as an amendment to the previously mentioned sb 7 it is now headed to the governors desk what to watch for though its more likely than the health care compact dont bet on the federal government giving texas the authority to use federal funds without any strings attached bill sb 28 would institute a statewide ban on smoking in bars restaurants and many public places if passes supporters say it would save an estimated 31 million dollars in medicaid spending over the next biennium status passed the senate health and human services committee and headed to the senate floor where it will likely land today what to watch for despite widespread public support for the measure it faces opposition from owners of smokerfriendly establishments and a corps of conservative lawmakers who killed the amendment during the regular session even if it makes it out of the senate it will likely die on the clock congressional redistricting  bill sb 4 is the texas legislatures effort to draw congressional maps for the next decade the bill passed the house last week following hours of debate in which democrats argued that the redistricting plans under consideration would ensure minority voters lack proper representation in congress the plan approved by the supermajority in the house resembles the version that came out of the house redistricting committee on june 9 in short it preserves the gops overwhelming majority the states congressional delegation status the bill has passed the house and senate and has been sent to the governor what to watch for the bill is on its way to the governors desk but lawmakers on both sides of the aisle acknowledge the issue is likely to be settled by a court or the us department of justice whether the governor vetoes it signs it or lets it become law without his signature democrats contend sb 4 violates the federal voting rights act and diminishes minority voting blocs by splitting them into different districts texas windstorm insurance association twia bill hb 3 is meant to overhaul the claims process for homeowners along the coast whose properties are damaged by hurricanes and to ensure that twia the states insurer of last resort remains solvent last week lawmakers were at odds on how much to limit homeowners ability to sue twia to recover damages when the agency fails to honor their insurance policies over the weekend state representative john smithee ramarillo and state senator john carona rdallas developed a compromise that would clarify what twia has to do when it settles claims it also would limit what lawyers can collect when suing over mishandled and inadequate claim settlements i think weve reached kind of a delicate balance smithee said status the house and senate conference committee has filed a report which still needs approval from the full house and senate what to watch for the new rules wont apply to cases already on file when the bill takes effect  probably in october  if lawmakers approve the deal but it would change the provisions of policies that are already in force perry and texans for lawsuit reform have made a priority of the bill the texas trial lawyers association has been on the other side and theres a personal edge to it too prominent plaintiffs attorney steve mostyn has made a specialty of twia claims and also happens to be the texas democrat who spent the most money trying to get perry defeated in the 2010 election cycle perry has said he wants the twia issue resolved before hurricanes season if lawmakers dont pass the legislation perry has promised to call yet another special session sanctuary cities bill sb 9 and hb9 would ban and prevent sanctuary cities in texas it it passes texas law enforcement officials will be allowed to inquire about the immigration status of people they detain or arrest any local entity that refuses to allow its peace officers to do so would be denied state funding hb9 only contains the sanctuary cities language whereas sb 9 also strengthens regulations for anyone applying for a drivers license or stateissued id in addition it expands the federal governments secure communities initiative to every detention facility in the state its already in every county jail status sb9 has passed the senate and is stalled in the house state affairs committee hb9 has yet to make it out of either chamber and is also pending in that committee what to watch for the state affairs committee did not meet monday which means the clock will likely run out on hb9 it has little chance of moving forward because even if it is passed out of committee today and is approved by the house on wednesday there would not be enough time to pass it out of the senate if the committee meets and passes out sb9 it would not see house floor action until wednesday it would have to be voted out and sent to the senate without amendments its likely house members would filibuster the bill before it even advanced that far keep in mind that rules pertaining to timing and layouts can always be suspended so the bills are clinging to life and are not dead until the final gavel bangs tsa antigroping bill bill hb 41 is intended to ban invasive patdowns by tsa agents during security screenings at airports perry added the issue to the special session call last week urged to do so by a number of lawmakers including state representative david simpson rlongview a similar proposal was pulled down in dramatic fashion during floor debate last month by an angry state senator dan patrick rhouston after the us department of justice warned that its passage could violate federal law and disrupt commercial flights in texas after negotiations over the bill broke down last friday house speaker joe straus shocked lawmakers by calling it a publicity stunt that would never be considered on the house floor as written  a panel was formed to make the bill more legally palatable it emerged on monday afternoon significantly

reasonable defense clause and a provision to salvage the bill should it be ruled unconstitutional in the courts representative allen fletcher rhouston offered an amendment to change the language of the bill from probable cause to reasonable suspicion  a lower standard for law enforcement to search someone taking no chances the senate passed its own version of the legislation sb 29 monday evening

afternoon its now headed for a third reading vote today the senate gave final approval to sb 29 one or the other has to pass both houses before the end of the session what to watch for simpson told reporters after the vote that he is slightly concerned the bill is going to third reading so close to the end of the session he said he accepted fletchers amendment because it was the best thing to do

jones who stormed the capitol with a rally of protesters after the original bill died in the regular session stormed the capitol again he called the altered version of the bill a monstrosity and

generally a bad idea to walk around drunk or brandish a gun in public or kiss other peoples wives borris miles a firstterm democratic state rep from houston managed to do all three in the same night miles transgressions at a nowinfamous holiday party in december contributed to a blowout loss on march 4 in his primary race against former state al edwards with no gop opponent edwards will return to the legislature where he served more than 20 years before losing to miles in 2006 in his previous stint edwards backed republican house speaker tom craddick he may well again if his campaign finance filings are any indication more than 75 percent of the 82000 edwards raised for his race came from wellknown republican donors that includes 35000 from houston homebuilder and craddick backer bob perry who bankrolled the swift boat attacks that helped sink john kerry perhaps the most disconcerting aspect of representative aaron peas second victory over challenger eddie saenz in the democratic primary in edinburg was his claim to underdog status pea is chairman of the criminal jurisprudence committee and a stalwart of republican speaker tom craddick a socalled craddick d  pea raised 424305 for the 2008 cycle according to campaign watchdog texans for public justice this princely sum included 106000 from the largest republican donor in the state bob perry yet pea declared that his winning margin just shy of a thousand votes was a victory over a well entrenched heavily financed boss and patronage system  since saenz lost to pea in both 2004 and 2008 it seems like the system isnt entrenched like it used to beor maybe it is republican representative phil king  is a selfprofessed christian but jesus doesnt win electionsmammon does king crushed his primary opponent public school advocate and former weatherford mayor joe tison with a little help from his friends the corporations he oversees as chairman of the house regulated industries committee energy and telecom interests not to mention governor rick perry and a craddickbacked pac poured huge sums of money into kings campaign coffers in the months before the election rather than turn water into wine king turned cash over 660000 since july 2007 into attack ads painting tison as a closet democrat tison pulled in almost 164000 including sizable contributions from texas parent pac a parentrun organization that promotes proeducation candidates the loss of the moderates and independents tison needed to the democratic presidential primary probably didnt help him either facing his first significant challenge in years representative ismael kino flores beat back opponent sandra rodriguez in the democratic primary in mission kino parlayed the power of incumbency read money and his support for republican speaker tom craddick read money into a 900vote victory the representative has reported raising 625670 in the 2008 cycle almost twice as much as rodriguezs total his contribution list reads like a whos who of lobbyists and republican donors including 11000 from lobby powerhouse hillco partners and 51000 from houston homebuilder bob perry despite his chairmanship of the licensing and administrative procedures committee which oversees gaming in the state flores also accepted 4000 from the littlefield corp which runs bingo games maybe dr james leininger should just stay out of the hill country

from fredericksburg to san antonio bedroom communities like schertz in 2006 leininger protg nathan macias raised a total of 552522 to unseat carter casteel leininger provided about 84 percent of macias money the incumbent did not support the doctors pet cause public school vouchers casteel lost in a squeaker to macias who supports vouchers despite efforts by ally speaker tom craddick leiningers 2007 voucher proposal failed again in the lege even macias didnt vote for it he abstained it now looks like that will be macias only opportunity despite an infusion of at least 74221 from leininger and almost 30000 more from a leiningerfunded political action committee macias lost to challenger doug miller by 38 votes macias has asked for a recount if hillary clinton threw the kitchen sink at barack obama recently in their relatively tame presidential primary thencontinuing the analogywhat major appliance did dr tom annunziator hurl at restaurateur  and state representative charlie geren a fullsized washer a walkin freezer their republican primary to determine who represents north fort worth in the texas house devolved into a shout fest with both candidates calling the other a liar one annunziato mailer even claimed geren put more drunk drivers behind the wheel  no matter gerena republican moderate and vocal critic of house speaker tom craddickwon a fifth term in the legislature annunziato an optometrist poured more than 400000 into the race a lot of that money came from craddick allies including the group texans for fiscal responsibility and san antonio millionaire james leininger who chipped in 75000 even with all the help annunziato lost by 17 points maybe he should stick to eye exams seventerm democratic incumbent representative dawnna dukes survived charges of being cozy with speaker tom craddick and taking cash from houston developer bob perry to win district 46 with 61 percent dukes who was born in east austin painted opponent brian thompson a lawyer who recently moved to the area as an interloper recruited by disgruntled democratic activists outside the district both candidates unleashed mudslinging television ads in the end dukes turned down a 50000 contribution from tom craddicks pac texas jobs  opportunity build a secure future inc to distance herself from the controversial speaker nonetheless she raised more than 350000exactly what she estimated she needed to win thompson raised 146177 when it comes to the money game dawnna knows how to play win dee margo bested longtime incumbent pat haggerty in el pasos only republican district the gop primary campaign cost nearly threequarters of a million dollars and featured candidates who courted conservatives and hurled insults haggerty characterized margo as a carpetbagger who only recently moved into a wellappointed apartment in the district margo summed up his opponent as too liberal and too friendly with lobbyists the texas house is going to miss the hardpartying haggerty judging from the numerous campaign contributions from legislators and beer distributors after all it was haggerty who at the 11th hour led the suicidal charge against speaker tom craddicks hamfisted leadership of the house margo will next face democrat and el paso county assistant district attorney joe moody in the general election democrats who voted for haggerty in the past expect the district to swing back to the democratic fold armando walle defeated incumbent representative kevin bailey in the democratic primary because of turnout not dollars the 30yearold walle is a product of district 140 in northeastern harris county until march 4 it was consistently one of the lowestturnout districts in the state in the democratic primary in 2006 only 1295 people cast ballots this cycle  bailey called in support from speaker tom craddick which garnered a 50000 check from craddicks texas jobs pac and 25000 from gopallied texans for lawsuit reform it wasnt enough a strong grassroots effort and heightened interest due to the presidential contest drove 8571 people to the polls walle won by 1267 votes almost the exact number of total votes in 2006 warning to all houstonarea republicans dont cross the senator from talk radio firstterm gop state senator dan patrick used his talk show to engineer the narrow defeat of fellow republican representativecorbin van arsdale by political newbie allen fletcher in his daily air assault patrick and other houston talkers accused van arsdale a threeterm conservative incumbent representing a district in northwestern harris county of betraying constituents by voting for a new business tax and for being weak on undocumented immigrants fletcher a bulldogish excop and homeland security entrepreneur will be a continuation of our revolution for change patrick said stay tuned texas republican voters in tom delays old district 22 went with the familiar on march 4 giving 30 percent of the vote to momentary congresswoman shelley sekula gibbs notorious for driving off delays staff during her sevenweek term in 2006 sekula gibbs will face pete olson in an april 8 runoff for the chance to challenge the incumbent democrat nick lampson sekula gibbs is painting olson who staffed for phil gramm and john cornyn for nine years as a washington insider which is what they call you when you can get a job in washington she also claims to be the true conservative olson is pointing to his national security experience he was in the navy for nine years and noting that sekula gibbs a dermatologist has none hes also calling sekula gibbs support of daylabor sites a vote for illegal immigrants sekula gibbs changed her vote when somebody informed her that illegal immigrants used the sites according to a gop source quoted in the dc paper the hill the republican establishment is firmly behind olson because sekula gibbs left a bitter taste in a lot of peoples mouths with her bizarre and erratic behavior and the texas delegation realizes that she is not a viable option in the general election  still sekula gibbs has name recognition the most money and significant community support in fact the pastor of a 12000member megachurch in houston offered sekula gibbs so much support that americans united for the separation of church and state called for an irs investigation pastor steve riggle wrote an endorsement letter for the sekula gibbs campaign on his personal stationery which identified him as the pastor of grace community church riggle urged a vote for sekula gibbs because she is the only candidate who will cosponsor legislation to give people of faith their voices back by letting them among other things legally endorse political candidates in the seven months since uranium energy corp applied to the texas commission on environmental quality for a permit to mine uranium in goliad county citizens and officials there have expressed their collective opposition through press conferences letters to public officials and wellattended public meetings now theyre pursuing legal action goliad county has notified uec that the county intends to sue the austinbased company for violating the federal safe drinking water act the county plans to file a separate lawsuit in federal court to force uec to halt uranium exploration in the county and repair any damage to the local aquifer created by exploratory drilling since it began in may 2006 uec officials responded with a statement any lawsuit filed regarding uranium energy corp s exploration activities is completely without merit and will be vigorously defended by the company the state agency with direct responsibility for the administration of the safe drinking water act has already thoroughly investigated the countys complaint and continues to actively fulfill its charge of ensuring the protection of the environment  in late march the state agency with direct responsibility the texas railroad commission  investigated th  companys drilling and found it in violation of state regulations for not adequately plugging some 74 exploratory holes the company responded by properly filling the holes in recent securities and exchange commission filings it boasted that as late as november 2007 the railroad commission praised uec for its prompt attention to restoring the drilling sites but in its notice of intent to sue goliad county officials claim to have found additional unplugged exploratory holes as recently as early february they allege that the improperly covered holes have already contaminated a portion of the evangeline aquifer which runs beneath the county further the lawsuit will allege that uec either intentionally or through gross negligence polluted the aquifer to facilitate its application for a uraniummining permit which is still under review by the tceq according to the notice to obtain the type of permit uec is seeking the company is required by the safe drinking water act to prove that the aquifer in the location of the proposed mine is unsuitable for drinking the county claims that the company did not take initial samples of the aquifer until december 2006roughly seven months after the company says it began drilling and some three months before the railroad commission cited the company for improperly plugging holes the lag time between drilling and baseline water testing the county alleges was designed to allow the aquifers water to degrade so that it would be deemed undrinkable and thus no hindrance to mining 
Political Intelligence - The Texas Observer	2008-02-08	TEXAS OBSERVER	http://www.texasobserver.org/2680-political-intelligence-the-means-behind-the-scenes/	en	state representative dawnna dukes a seventerm incumbent may have one of   the toughest and costliest primaries this election dukes reckons shell   need about 350000 to beat her democratic opponent brian thompson a political   newcomer in her east austin district why so much money to beat a political   newbie you ask the cost of supporting speaker tom craddick draws some serious   political blowback thompson a 27yearold lawyer says he was encouraged by   people in district 46 to run against dukes to be honest i was approached   and i had already heard grumbling in the district about the representative   he says her support of craddick has left a bad taste in their mouths  dukes 44 says she would rather be helping other democrats beat republicans than battle thompson campaigns have become way too expensive but it is a necessity when you are up against an opponent she says thompson says dukes is fielding big money from craddick heavy hitters such as bob perry who partially bankrolled the swift boat veterans for truth ads and is a key supporter of republican leaders in texas i think its sad when a seventerm democrat has to depend on money from republican ideologues thompson says asked about thompsons claim dukes counters that she will only talk about her campaign contributors off the record i was born in this district and he has only lived there for 13 months she says of her opponent when it comes to money its difficult to decipher how dukes operates she lists her occupation as private consultant and her personal financial statements required from all officeholders are mostly blank in 2006 the texas ethics commission hit her with a 600 administrative penalty for an inadequate campaign report recently she pledged to correct reports on campaign and office spending since 2000 including seven years worth of credit card expenditures she failed to disclose yet given her alliance with craddick it wont be difficult for her to raise that 350000 thompson says he has raised 25000 from individuals in district 46 and will counter her advantage with blockwalking and a strong message we fully expect her to be well funded by republican activists and lobbyists who want craddick to stay in power says thompson people in district 46 are smart enough to know where the money comes from  the man from talk radio freshman state senator dan patrick is trying to convince republican primary voters in house district 130 in the northwestern burbs of houston to toss their incumbent and put his guy in patrick knows a little about republican primaries in 2006 he bested three opponents by stoking his large houston radio audience with populist appeals to shake up austin and the republican establishment now after a 2007 legislative session in which his major accomplishment was getting in god we trust permanently displayed in the senate chamber patrick is looking for more help in austin as he puts it representative corbin van arsdale has represented district 130 which includes tomball and cy fair and lies within patricks senatorial district for six years without a serious challenger his opponent is allen fletcher a former houston cop and ceo of resource protection management a pinehurstbased security company that has profited in the post911 homeland security era fletchers outfit sells surveillance cameras and alarm systems to a surprising number of houstonarea school districts and local governments and also offers security services for corporations fearful of terrorism kidnappings and organized crime fletcher did not return several calls for comment but he describes himself on his web site as a tomball businessman community activist christian devoted husband and loving father  on a daily basis van arsdale says patrick and his fellow talkshow hosts flood the airwaves with tales of van arsdale doing the austin shuffle failing to vote with his district on taxation illegal immigration and government spending fletchers against all three im not just running against allen fletcher van arsdale says im running against an entire radio station  the senator declined to comment opting instead to make a campaign consultant available you might call it a continuation of our revolution for change goes part of one of patricks pitches for fletcher posted on his campaign web site some revolution despite the name evoking minor dutch nobility van arsdale is a pretty standard whatyouseeiswhatyouget conservative republican hes for lower taxes and against illegal immigration for tort reform and against abortion van arsdale happily touted to the observer his ranking by the heritage alliance a conservative organization as one of the most conservative members of the legislature van arsdale suspects that patrick has it out for him because he backed one of patricks primary opponents in 2006 i think the votes fletcher pulls are from people who believe whatever dan tells them instead of looking at what the real story is van arsdale says some suspect whats really going on is that patrick is building a houston political machine that will come in handy whenor ifhe decides to run for governor tom craddicks name wont appear on the ballot but the republican primary in fort worths texas house district 99 is all about him the incumbent representative charlie geren a gravelvoiced restaurant owner known for his directness is one of the houses more independent republicans he has clashed for years with craddick the threeterm house speaker at the end of last session geren joined a handful of republicans who tried to oust craddick from the speakers chair the mud salesman from midland has a long memory and the man can nurture a grudge like few others moreover craddick needs more friendly republicans elected to the house if he hopes to win another term as speaker at the beginning of the 2009 session so it wasnt surprising that geren drew a primary opponent or that the election will be largely a referendum on craddick the challenger is fort worth optometrist tom annunziato no evidence has emerged that craddick or his allies recruited annunziato for the race and geren says he doesnt know if the speaker was involved but political observers in austin who have watched craddick operate over the years have their suspicions annunziato didnt respond to interview requests from the observer annunziatos last campaign finance report was an impressive sight the challenger reported raising more than 178000 through the end of december and had 147933 in the bank at the end of 2007 the large majority of annunziatos money came from optometristsseemingly every eye doctor in the state has contributed including more than 78000 from the texas optometric pac annunziato was once president of the texas optometric association geren isnt short on money either hes got 160617 on hand and hes beaten wellfunded challengers before in 2006 he won reelection despite a primary opponent who had received more than 800000 from james leininger the wealthy school voucher proponent and craddick ally geren says leininger told him he would stay out of gerens race this time around i take dr leininger as a man of his word geren said i dont believe dr leiningers going to be in my race  that doesnt mean other campaign funders and political action committees loyal to craddick wont back annunziato in 2006 geren saw money from craddick allies flow to his opponent in the weeks just before the primary unlike two years ago geren is openly criticizing the speaker during the campaign he recently mailed a campaign flier to voters touting his opposition to craddick i think we need a new republican speaker geren told the observer under speaker craddicks leadership weve gone from 88 to 79 republican seats i think its time we had different leadership though i believe it needs to be republican leadership  in this era of christian fundamentalism the voices of religious moderates and progressives often seem lost amid the incessant amens and hallelujahs from the religious right but people of faith concerned with social justice havent gone away at the 20th annual united methodist women legislative event held at a downtown austin hotel in late january women from all over the state gathered to discuss how to restore the notion of the common good and social justice to texas politics the methodist women didnt look like a fiery crowd many were whitehaired and came dressed in prim pantsuits yet during questionandanswer sessions they showed a passion for change in policy sessions they learned the intricacies of the political process while brainstorming ways to make education the environment and health care top priorities again texas impact an interfaith organization that marries progressive religious values with political action hosted the event at a dinner on the conferences second night the women heard from campaign strategist and former bush aide matthew dowd and campaign finance reformer fred lewis dowd described the current zeitgeist nearly every major institution in this county the american public the people of texas have lost faith in them he said that loss of faith he said has disconnected us from each other we dont feel part of a community we dont know where to turn  lewis reminded the audience that they are drawn together by community and a faith in the common good right now in this country we dont have a problem of too much community we have individualism run amuck he said many of the legislative seminars focused on how children fare in texas it aint good you probably know some of the grim stats josette saxton with the nonprofit texans care for children told the crowd that texas is especially stingy with early childhood development resources childrens brains develop mostly by age 3 yet public investment for toddlers is scant daycare workers earn a small hourly wage the job requires only high school equivalency and eight hours of training if were serious about building community saxton said we must invest in young children the methodist women will carry that message back to legislative districts across the state the group pledged to make 450 visits to lawmakers before november

CHRONICLE	http://www.chron.com//neighborhood/spring-news/article/Health-care-food-programs-human-trafficking-1717469.php	en	the community impact of health care state funding human trafficking and payday lending businesses were highlighted during a recent panel discussion hosted by northwest assistance ministries for the third year nam hosted a breakfast and legislative forum for area state representatives harris county and houston city officials the forum was divided into two panels the first panel discussing health care and human trafficking were houston mayor annise parker houston city councilman co brad bradford state representatives ellen cohen allen fletcher and debbie riddle harris county sheriff adrian garcia harris county commissioner sylvia garcia and harris county precinct 4 constable ron hickman the second panel addressing hunger and payday lending were state representatives gary elkins armando walle ana hernandez riddle and senfronia thompson moderator for the forum was tom forestier past chairman nam executive board on the topic of health care forestier said budget shortfalls could cut programs such as medicaid and chips and result in increased use of hospital and emergency rooms increasing costs at the state level parker said the key is preventive health care and having a regular health provider the mayor talked about increasing immunizations and prenatal care while working with harris county officials our focus has been on how we can keep people healthier on the front end and focus on wellness activities and making sure the kids are immunized and the communitybased health clinics are strategically located around houston so that people have access in their neighborhoods so they can begin to form that permanent healthcare relationship she said with the legislature returning to session in the spring forestier asked what legislation could be formed to prevent a reduction of services to the medically underserved while reducing the cost to the uninsured i dont believe there is any type of state legislation that we can go in with cohen said we are facing a 16 billion budget shortfall the people of texas are hurting going in and demanding more money from them is not an option  forestier addressed human trafficking its a global issue forestier said the national human trafficking hotline receives more calls for assistance from the city of houston than any other city in the us  cohen added were talking about an issue that affects 800000 people a year around the world its an enormous problem what can we do at the state level weve done a couple of things we passed house bill 4009 that established a trafficking task force it was set up to really look into the issues and see exactly what we can do as far as i can tell funds have been appropriated for it but its going to be a little bit down the road before that takes place the other thing we can do is try to tap any kind of bill that tries to limit and penalize human trafficking i was able to put into place a 5 fee that was leveled against sexually oriented businesses if it cost 10 to go to one it now costs 15 and that 5 goes for programs that involve sexual assault programs that 5 fee raises over 30 million a year  the fm 1960 area in particular has seen an increase in gangs human trafficking and other crimes as well as issues related to sexually oriented businesses since 2004 gangs in all areas of houston have increased 17 percent gangrelated crime has increased 250 percent youve heard from representative cohen how significant our human trafficking problem is as houston continues to be a transportation and distribution point for narcotics weapons and humans garcia said and were seeing just the tip of the iceberg at the sheriffs office we only have five people working for me with the fbi to investigate these sobs four are funded by a grant and one is on your dole  the harris county jail is the largest in the state of texas we house an average of 10500 people there i want to announce to you that in the near future you will be hearing about our relationship with crime stoppers new persons coming into the county jail male or female will walk into an environment where they will communicate to crime stoppers things that are occurring in their community its going to look a little bit like need a lawyer need bond money call crime stoppers  garcia said theyd also be looking into their prostitution cases for information about human trafficking but doing the job with five people is a real challenge the issue of families in a food program and its costeffectiveness in harris county was discussed by walle we spend about 15 million in fingerprinting to prevent fraud with one case being proven he said this year well spend another 17 million doing the process again we can eliminate that  walle said doing so would cut down on the waiting time for families to receive food we can also streamline the program with the asset test walle said there are very few instances of folks who are getting a huge inheritance that would knock them off the food stamp program  elkins responded to the issue of payday lending by saying many people who secure payday loans cant pay them back on payday they begin a cycle of adding to their debt each payday which is exactly what the lenders want he reiterated that congress cannot regulate or control the law of supply and demand and the law of unattended consequences he went on to explain how payday lending has affected bankruptcies bank fees and other bank charges he said in states that have outlawed payday lending all lending has gone underground or to the internet and the states now have absolutely no regulatory authority elkins said its an issue about which little can be done

what you need use it wisely use it well  she echoed the comments of an earlier speaker who has two daughters in the district a speaker quotes from board president lou bertolis bio on cyfairs web site as a taxpayer the 20 percent homestead exemption that cyfair maintains is important to me it acts as a significant support for residential property values and reflects the districts ability to educate in a fiscally responsible manner  the last speaker tells the board to have courage to remove the optional homestead exemption if thats what is needed some applause some booing 728 pm board goes into closed session and will return off to do some interviews 805 pm the board is back in public trustee lida woodul asked anthony how much cutting the exemption to 10 percent would cost taxpayers he said the owner of a 100000 home would see an increase of 124 trustee larry youngblood tried to clarify earlier comments by trustee ethel wolfes son michael youngblood said that he did not discuss his vote with ethel wolfe last night and did not agree to vote in step with her he said he didnt know how he was going to vote until he left the closeddoor meeting hmm wonder what trustees talked about behind those closed doors youngblood my major consideration here is to make sure we keep as many jobs as we can  woodul wants the administration to say how all the options on the table would increase their tax rate thanks ms woodul i was wondering the same thing if the board cuts the exemption to 10 percent the tax rate would go up 45 cents if the board keeps the full exemption the rate would go up 6 cents in response to board questions anthony and the districts attorney are trying to count how many positions would be cut theres some confusion over the numbers but anthony said its up to about 140 not sure why these numbers arent solid these are peoples jobs right i do need to clarify though whether these are layoffs or just positions cut meaning there wouldnt necessarily be layoffs if i didnt mention this earlier anthony put three options on the table the first one his recommendation would cut the exemption to 10 percent and would include nearly 18 million in cuts including about 140 positions if im understanding this correctly there arent any handouts with the numbers so its hard to follow the first option also gives all employees a three percent raise the second option keeps the exemption gives a 2 percent raise and calls for a rollback election aka a tax increase if voters approve it the third option also keeps the exemption and gives no raise not sure about the tax rate a trustee made a motion to take no action on the local exemption homestead exemption stays vote was 51 woodul voted against it she wanted to cut it to 10 percent our role is to think of the children she said sorry deadline called heres a link to the article which includes more details about the boards decisions thanks to some clarification from the boards attorney marney collinssims the bottom line 20 percent optional homestead exemption stays at least 75 employees lose their jobs the tax rate still is expected to go up six cents teachers nurses librarians speech pathologists and counselors will get the statemandated raise no raises for other employees details about 142 million in cuts havent been worked out other than the approximately 75 layoffs and the board likely will be having similar budget discussions next year with that good night

and we begin a chronicle of the american conservatory theaters four decades in the bay area continuing monday in datebook we also consider just what qualifies as a birthday in the theater anyway podcast rob hurwitt with acts ray reinhardt  podcast rob hurwitt with angela paton and bob goldsby  they were wild times it was a wild ride until we landed in san francisco and even then it was pretty wild   judith mihalyi auberjonois original act company member i was working on oliver in chicago as production manager wed closed on broadway and moved to chicago and bill ball called and said i have a great plan im on my way to milwaukee to meet with ford foundation officials and i want to stop in chicago and talk to you about it  this was i think january maybe december anyway we sat up all night in chicago and talked about how to do this theater   about a week later he called me back and said well change this paragraph or that paragraph and finally i realized that he was talking about beginning five months hence i had thought we were planning for at least 17 months hence i said bill you cant do all that in less than 15 months and he said yes yes we can so i said if you say we can do it we can do it so we did it   ed hastings founding member of act artistic director 198690  we started in 1965 in pittsburgh and had a spectacular season in two theaters  bill ball was a graduate of what was then known as the carnegie institute of technology which had a great drama department still does its now known as carnegie mellon university  we did six months there i dont think bill ever really intended for the company to stay in pittsburgh but thats how he could get it started   rene auberjonois original company member  we opened in pittsburgh in june with tartuffe which was bills triumphant lincoln center production  hed had the presence of mind or something to buy the costumes which were exquisite   ed hastings  every year is an anniversary of some sort but this season is something special among a host of anniversaries two of san franciscos highestprofile theater companies are celebrating their 40th seasons in the following pages we take a look at whats going on at the 40yearold magic theatre and we begin a chronicle of the american conservatory theaters four decades in the bay area continuing monday in datebook we also consider just what qualifies as a birthday in the theater anyway the opening night of tartuffe we knew the audience was over the moon about it i remember going back to my dressing room after the curtain call which was downstairs far away from the stage i took off my wig and was half out of my costume when suddenly there was this sort of rabidlooking creature standing in the doorway screaming get back on the stage get back on the stage bill was going crazy the audience was still standing and stamping their feet   rene auberjonois  the idea of a standing performing company with a school or conservatory aspect attached was what i always thought would be ideal  the combination of the things in a real practical and honest way so that the principles were expressed in what you were doing so immediately you could create productions and have the minorleague players getting ready to come in and take over  and the other thing was programming that was not exactly esoteric but where the great plays of various eras would be performed those were the two things good plays and good training and that the professional company would also continue to train and train the junior company  the unity of training and performing   ed hastings  pittsburgh was going to be the home of act  but bill ball and the board had a difference of opinion he wanted complete artistic control and they didnt want to give it to him  so we left went on the road   ray reinhardt longtime company member  then we began gypsying around the country we went to ann arbor mich we went to the goodspeed opera house in massachusetts we had a period in the wilderness in new york not performing just rehearsing things then we went to the ravinia festival in chicago and they went crazy for us and then we came to stanford and the whole chamber of commerce from san francisco took a bus down and saw the opening night of charleys aunt then chicago and san francisco got into a kind of bidding war over who would get act   rene auberjonois  1966 pbs broadcasts acts productions of shaws misalliance directed by michael howard and dylan thomas under milk wood directed by ball a group of bay area civic leaders later named the california theater foundation guarantees financial backing for acts first sixmonth season in san francisco among the leaders of the group are melvin swig mortimer fleishhacker and cyril magnin i reviewed all the paperwork that existed which was not very much and came to the conclusion that we were a million dollars short because they hadnt budgeted for any production crew or frontofthehouse staff at all theyd been on the road and had never paid for any of that so theyd forgotten but i was game it was all so exciting we honestly believed that we were going to change the american theater period we bought into bills idea that we could change the way theater worked by building a huge rotating repertory company and a conservatory along european  lines   bill bushnell acts first managing director later founder of the los angeles center now a consultant for fluor daniels reached in quito ecuador in transit from the galapagos to the amazon basin  bill was a brilliant motivator and thats a skill that very few people have  to be able to talk with such clarity about his vision for the theater and where youre going it worked for me for 12 years   james haire joined act in 1971 as stage manager now producing director he was a madman a mad genius people would ask what is it like to work with bill ball and i could only say that i learned to try not to listen to him but just to watch him and try to absorb the energy that he was exuding from every pore   rene auberjonois  i came out on the airplane with bill ball and ed hastings on halloween 1966 and went into the geary and we opened within three months the most chaotic 10 weeks youve ever seen john seig and i had to negotiate all the actors contracts and put the management team together none of which had existed before in addition to all the designers and production people we were negotiating 11 union contracts and san francisco is a tough union town wed do four days in new york and three in san francisco and we flew at night i was so exhausted i fell asleep in the front row at the final dress rehearsal for tartuffe it took rene years to forgive me   bill bushnell  1967 tartuffe opens jan 21 at the geary theater inaugurating a sixmonth 16production season in two theaters act also plays 28 performances in 13 other cities in the state the opening night of tartuffe in san francisco was as spectacular as pittsburgh  ive seen a lot of rock concerts  and i know that those two opening nights will remain the closest ill ever get to that sort of whatever the beatles or elton john or those people experience with an audience   rene auberjonois  we are now like the hungry citizen who has already had a delicious meal even though dessert has not yet been served the american conservatory theater has in three weeks presented five productions  in two theaters it may well be the most dynamic ambitious enthralling and outrageous adventure in the american theater today   paine knickerbocker the chronicle feb 12 1967  that first season was monumental i mean you could see three plays at the geary and two at the marines five plays by act in a week it was wonderful we were a very happy company   ray reinhardt  dick richard dysart was a character man in the beginning and he said that when he was standing in the wings hed have to look down at what costume he was wearing to know what play he was in he was in nine different plays i think that was the record   angela paton company member later founded berkeley stage company  during its final week this spring in san francisco the company will present its repertory 15 productions in two theaters   paine knickerbocker the chronicle april 30 1967  in that first spring i played tartuffe in tartuffe and fancourt babberly in charlies aunt i directed and was in beyond the fringe i did endgame i alternated roles in endgame i did under milk wood i did the complete man and superman john tanner the lead including the don juan in hell scene i mean what was put on my shoulders as a twentysomethingyearold actor ultimately it was too much and i had to leave the company because i could not i didnt have  i didnt do the drugs that could sustain something like that you couldnt do the drugs and do all that and if you didnt do the drugs you couldnt sustain it   rene auberjonois  we were no angels that company flew on booze and pills   bill bushnell  it was very exciting but when i look back at it i dont see a lot of chaos i see a lot of hard work it paid off  it was real theater right from the beginning  there was something exciting about this theater that was going to make itself better from performance to performance it was a very energizing place to be   ed hastings  all the company members were part of the conservatory so if you had a call for rehearsal in the day  there was this board and you had to see what else you were doing you might have a singing class and a fencing class alexander technique any number of things   ray reinhardt  the scheduling was brilliant we didnt have computers there was some poorly paid person sitting at a desk with a grid in front of her scheduling every actor in the company  36 actors  for rehearsals and teaching and classes because that was the wonderful part of it we continued our training as we were acting and teaching we would rehearse one play for three hours in the morning and then teach a class have a break rehearse another play in the afternoon and take a class if you were in a play you would only work half a day either teach or rehearse the next play it was complicated and it was beautifully done   joy carlin longtime company member associate artistic director 198690  i dont know that i slept for four years if you werent in a studio taking a lesson which could be anything from tai chi to tap dancing you were rehearsing a play or across the street performing   kitty winn company member compiling an oral history of act  no other company in the country did the teaching aspect and acting together as if they were part of the same theater that was what was so exciting about it  i came in as an associate director and i began the conservatory with a huge program that summer called the summer congress  i put it together with local people and company members and found 10 rooms we had 20 students in each class and they rotated around the lobby and every place we could squeeze in a class   the main academic problem was that all these students were also used in the productions  there were something like 27 productions that first year and some of them were on the road so they were always going to rehearsal and the people teaching the classes would have 10 people one day and then they wouldnt come back for a week  i think that was finally solved by using the students only after they finished the course   bob goldsby director first conservatory director  1969 bill bushnell leaves act allen fletcher is named conservatory director it was 10 shows in a 36week season we always ended by the end of may so we had our summers off and we had i guess the maximum was five shows backstage at any one time so we could do five different plays a week all totally in rep of course there was a permanent acting company which allowed for that flexibility i think the company was like 38 people and we used the secondyear students in nonspeaking roles so there were quite a few people backstage   james haire  i think what is astonishing is the breadth of talent bill assembled in the first couple of years  the depth of the casting was so rich character men strong leading men funny men and just very experienced actors  there were wigmakers and makeup people who knew makeup and there were good designers just a rich layering of talent and that was all from bill he found these people and they agreed to come   bob goldsby  bill had an amazing eye and not just for the actor but for the lighting designers the costume designers he just knew how to draw these people in and then turn them loose  hed studied to be a designer and he knew a lot about every aspect of theater   kitty winn  wonderful things to remember were the walkdowns bill sprung that on the company and the audience early on at the last performance of the season the curtain call of every play in that season was reprised so the curtain would go down on whatever the last play was and then the music would come up from the oneill play wed done earlier and four or five actors from that play would come down in costume take a bow and so on for every play in that season until the entire company was onstage in all those costumes to the last strains of the firebird the audience went nuts it came as a complete surprise the first time but after that people would die to be at that final performance it was great showmanship   joy carlin  bill had this word positation he would say never say no of course this was good for him because he didnt like people saying no to him but it was also a wonderful way to work on a play to be open to any suggestion then through doing what you might not want to do wouldnt have thought to do you have another thought and his mind would feed on whatever idea youd come up with and youd end up exactly where you really wanted to be its sort of a lesson for life too though of course there are times one should say no   kitty winn  the point is that if you entertain everybodys idea eventually you get to the right one but unless you say yes all along the way you might not get to that great idea  bill had some genius in him he was a very nutty person he was a man who did not play by the rules  but he had a power to lead and he was willing to stand in front of everybody and if he had to make a fool of himself hed make a fool of himself in order to get done what he wanted to do   annette bening former act student and company member  ed hastings was a wonderful calming influence his presence probably meant that there was as little bloodshed as there was   there was always a kind of pushpull about how decisions were gonna get made i dont think anybody questioned that bill was the leader the question was whether he was connected enough to make daytoday decisions  there were moments when we tried to isolate him from a management perspective because we couldnt do our job otherwise bills basic approach was management by chaos  and thats a perfectly valid approach as long as its not completely out of control   bill bushnell  as the company aged two or three years there were tensions i remember sitting in the office with bill and he asked me why does everyone hate me angie im only trying to make everyone happy david grimes cast as feste in twelfth night got sick and bill ball decided he would play feste which he had always wanted to do but he was so sick at heart so not himself by that time that when he came on to say his first lines to me maria he couldnt remember any of them he just knelt there in front of me looking up at me and id say my line then his line then my line  until finally i took him off stage   angela paton  there were all kinds of problems bill had with drugs and isolating himself from the company and making extremely bad casting decisions putting his little friends in major roles and stuff like that  yet we all knew that he was the one who had all the big ideas about this company and we were trying to implement them but it wasnt always easy   bob goldsby  1970 james mckenzie becomes executive producer 1971 act young conservatory founded under the direction of ross and lou ann graham 1972 plays in progress acts newplay program founded by ed hastings bill balls period was very exciting he was a brilliant guy and  wonderfully supportive in terms of not interfering with other directors and he himself did some wonderful things  but he faded away with all the financial business which i never did quite understand   laird williamson director  it was very much an actors company thats why we did all the studying the conservatory never stopping your training i think most theaters now not just act have become more designers theaters in the repertory system the designs were brilliant but they had to be folded up each night so we could do the next show so they couldnt possibly be as elaborate as some of them are today   joy carlin  1974 cyrano de bergerac starring peter donat and marsha mason broadcast by pbs act purchases geary theater with a grant from the ford foundation 1975 balls production of the taming of the shrew starring marc singer and fredi olster broadcast by pbs another high point was the russian tour when matchmaker and desire under the elms went to russia  in 1975 we went to moscow st petersburg and riga latvia  they would do an instant translation on headphones so the laugh line would come and a few seconds later the laugh would come which made things very difficult to play  then in riga they refused to listen to the play in russian so they took their earphones off and basically pretended to understand the english  it was their little act of protest against the soviet union   laird williamson  an angry edward albee threatened to close acts production of his drama tiny alice this weekend he feels that director william ball has extensively and illegally rewritten the text the renowned playwright breezed into town on friday to attend a preview performance at the geary and hit the ceiling he rushed backstage to have it out with ball but the director albee said made himself unavailable albee had words with act executive producer james mckenzie and demanded that the play be restored to its original form  stanley eichelbaum san francisco examiner oct 5 1975  when i came to see it on its last preview and discovered that the play had been cut and revised by the late occasionally lamented mr ball i tried to close the production down and discovered that i could not close it down because they hadnt bothered to get a contract to do the play in the first place   edward albee city arts  lectures april 15 1996  the asian american theater workshop and black actors workshop in both cases it was actors who came to me and said this is what we want to do what we think the company should do there was a pretty good core of black actors in san francisco who needed and wanted a place to improve their craft so they spoke through the black actors who were in the company they came forward and said theyd help out as teachers and organizers with the asian american workshop i had a meeting with frank chin the playwright  not sure who instigated it frank said youre never going to do an asian play so why are we talking i said you havent written a play that we want to do yet we sort of argued back and forth about the chicken and the egg finally i said if there were a nucleus of 10 or 20 even if they werent getting paid but were avocational actors would you write a play for them so that they could train that sort of turned him on that he would have a company learning to speak his words i think chickencoop chinaman was already in the works but the world premiere came through the workshop   ed hastings asian american theater workshop became the asian american theater company  bill wanted to do a christmas carol and he approached dennis powers and me  we were pretty convinced that it would be great if it were a script that was generated from inside act as opposed to going afield and selecting one by committee thats how it happened we had no idea at the time that it would go for as long as it did  we wanted to eliminate a lot of the cliches and kitsch that surrounded the story and do it as purely as possible in its own way i think it was a beautiful production   laird williamson  1979 act receives regional theater tony award the

CHRONICLE	http://www.chron.com//entertainment/article/A-Landmark-Transformation-Six-years-after-the-3016555.php	en	 stepping back into the rebuilt geary theater as the public finally will do next month for a gala reopening and performance of shakespeares the tempest is a heady timetraveling experience more than six years after the 1989 loma prieta earthquake unleashed its wrath the citys finest and most storied playhouse is about to return to life renewed and yet wonderfully unchanged in a 275 million restoration that preserves and improves the 1910 horseshoe auditoriums incomparable intimacy enriches the theaters artistic potential and enhances audience amenities the gearys ghosts are set to summon a new generation of theater lovers a dramatic time line of actors who have played the house runs from sarah bernhardt and laurence olivier to katherine cornell and paul robeson and on to acts own annette bening and sydney walker violently interrupted in 89 the theaters continuity is now restored gazing up above the rebuilt proscenium now blissfully free of the obstructive light bridge that fell during the quake the viewer discovers a quadruple ribbon of golden rosettes arched over the playing space that decorative span now connects play and playgoers as never before with its balconies trimmed by a 21inchthick seismic shear wall at the back of the house and the orchestra floor raked and reconfigured with better sight lines and more legroom on the main floor the audience is free to focus on the action the gearys new capacity is 1024 down from the 1380 seats that once yawned into the distant reaches of the two balconies leg room in the stepped balconies could not be improved what the smaller audience wont see directly are the major backstage improvements they include a hydraulically elevated stage with modular traps computerized counterweight rigging to fly in scenery more efficiently new lighting positions and a computerized sound system improved dressing rooms and enlarged scenestorage space to accommodate a rotating repertory of productions other changes will be more immediately apparent coliseum stone staircases adorned with a thatch of spanish art nouveau tube steel and crowned with fancifully twirled brass handrails rise from the floor of a refurbished lobby with the box office moved to an adjacent building the grand staircase to the left sweeps upward from a space cleared of ticket queues the smaller staircase on the right side of the lobby wraps around a small new elevator the grandest of the new public spaces is the bar on the upper level which takes up two stories and looks out onto geary street through the theaters three dominant arched windows now unobstructed by the boards and curtains that blocked them for many years the redesigned freds columbia room in the basement which honors both the late longtime head usher fred geick and the theaters original name has a 25foot bar of polished granite as its new centerpiece the carpeting designed by project interior decorator deborah cibilich features swirls of dark purple burgundy and gold over a sagegreen background and theres good news for women who suffered most acutely from the shortage of rest room facilities in the old geary the number of womens stalls has been increased from nine to 26 the men get 21 stalls for a theater that artistic director carey perloff has called one of the most perfect performing spaces in the country doing no damage was a guiding principle of the restoration the architectural plan  conceived by esherick homsey dodge and davis and completed by gensler and associatesarchitects  had to balance multiple demands to meet stringent seismic and safety codes preserve the historic integrity of the building and improve the stagecraft technology an audience members dominant impression  once the extra legroom in the orchestra seats has sunk in  will be how much like the old geary the new one looks and feels the original color scheme and details remain even the auditoriums mundane wainscoting and peculiar arched door frames now over the new fire doors are the same  features protected by the buildings historic status there are subtle but telling improvements as well such as the understated alabaster globes mounted beneath the balcony the new fixtures which replace bigger and brighter ones make the overhang appear higher from below when in fact the balcony now looms closer to the rear of the raked orchestra floor how the geary will function as a theater housing and projecting the work of the artists is the critical question and one that can be answered only with time asked about the fabled acoustics act sound designer stephen legrand said its also too soon to tell how the smaller and slightly altered shape of the auditorium will affect the audibility and clarity of lines spoken on stage we want the architecture to sing he said as it always did in the past  the tempest will certainly show off some of the theaters new technical muscle we can thunder like the movies now legrand said of the effects in the opening storm sequence kate edmunds set will feature flown scenery use the orchestra pit as prime real estate and employ crushed vellum walls to receive balinese shadow projections by larry reed i will be able to do things i couldnt do in any regional theater before lighting designer peter maradudin said add a david lang score played by the kronos quartet movement by margaret jenkins actors popping out of traps and flying in from above and this tempest sounds loaded with theatrical firepower but the collaborators all emphasized the primacy of the text in this staging of shakespeares last masterpiece i didnt want the production to be so busy that the actor wouldnt be at the center of it perloff said i dont want it to be about technology i want it to be about the power of the imagination  and edmunds added im designing a specific production of the tempest im not doing a reopening of the geary  yet however the rehabilitated theaters curtainraiser turns out the fact that it is happening at all must be seen as a triumph of collective will in the fluid world of nonprofit theater many who helped rebuild the theater are no longer players at act back in the early 1990s when thenmanaging director john sullivan was ensnared in a bureaucratic tangle with the federal emergency management agency it was not at all clear when or to what extent the government would help rebuild the quakedamaged theater fema eventually came through with 115 million alan stein the board chairman who led the fundraising campaign conceded that a shaky start by perloff as artistic director and some big operating deficits had also cast shadows on the project as some major foundation grants kicked in act also was getting its act together in its temporary homes at the stage door and marines memorial theaters meanwhile according to stein the artistic and boxoffice successes of angels in america othello hecuba and arcadia helped breathe new energy into the geary campaign the board alone contributed 35 million even today as the geary reopens its freshly painted doors the 1989 images of the dangling light bridge and devastated proscenium remain potent and unforgettable all theater is fragile and ephemeral the brave and stirring folly we share of wanting time to stand still

in his remarks hillegeist mentioned a future of greater mobility and the resulting economic development that is already beginning to occur last year several restaurants and retail establishments opened at the academy center on fm 2920 and texas 249 including a panera bread restaurant and a carls jr both of which had very strong openings hillegeist said newquest properties has plans to build a sams club along texas 249 and rudys barbecue is advertising a new restaurant site on texas 249 south at northpointe boulevard brody farris senior leasing agent for weingarten realty said there are a lot of reasons economic growth is happening in tomball and along texas 249 we are seeing a lot of activity in tomball with many new concepts both local and national looking to enter the market farris said outside of tomball being a great community i would attribute some of this growth in the area to the grand parkway new home construction and of course exxon  currently texas 249 extends about 27 miles from interstate 45 in northern harris county to fm 1774 in pinehurst passing through north houston and tomball crews have been adding lanes on texas 249 from springcypress road northwest to wallertomball road by 2016 the new lanes will be extended to fm 1774 near pinehurst this section known as the tomball parkway will have at least three new toll lanes in each direction most of the work will occur within the wide median of the existing texas 249 motorists will still mostly be able to travel free along frontage roads that will parallel the new toll road the tomball parkway segment would very likely have remained a fourlane road going north just beyond the tomball city limits if it were not for the formation and subsequent actions of the 249 partnership that organized in 2012 the partnership which has representatives from tomball magnolia and navasota helped provide the motivation to representatives in harris montgomery and grimes counties to work toward completing a new northsouth corridor from texas 6 near college station to houston however the process of this roadway becoming a reality is only being seen in harris county right now but will soon change harris county precinct 4 commissioner jack cagle who partnered with the 249 partnership and state representative allen fletcher rtomball to spearhead funding for the project said millions of motorists per year will benefit from the added mobility of texas 249 when the project is completed this is one of those rare projects that benefits the urban area of harris county benefits the moderate populated region like montgomery county and the rural areas beyond montgomery county while it helps bring regional mobility cagle said the montgomery county commissioners court gave precinct 2 commissioner craig doyal authority to speak with the texas department of transportation and begin negotiations for the eventual construction of texas 249 harris county and montgomery county have an agreement to jointly develop the portion from brown road to fm 1774 in montgomery county near pinehurst two other segments are under environmental studies currently by txdot which include texas 249 from fm 1774 in montgomery county near pinehurst to fm 1774 in grimes county near todd mission txdot spokesman danny perez said state officials anticipate drafting the environmental impact statement and holding public hearings on the project toward the end of 2014 meanwhile doyal who has worked closely with cagle and harris county on its portion of the roadway said montgomery county has primacy on the project which means it can decide when or if it will actually be built there will probably be portions of that we want to build and portions that we will turn over to txdot or that we may partner with them to work together on doyal said we just need those negotiations to determine what makes sense for everybody so it is advantageous to txdot and the county so we can get this project built  and once the project is completed or near completed in montgomery county residents could also see a lot of that same explosive economic growth its a chicken and the egg issue cagle said commerce is coming period and the road will help alleviate some of the pressure brought in by this increased commerce

                          2014 Primary: Tonya Rolland McLaughlin for CC-10         	2014-05-23	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://blog.chron.com/bigjolly/2014/05/2014-primary-tonya-rolland-mclaughlin-for-cc-10/	en	 tonya rolland mclaughlin and dan spjut in the republican primary runoff for harris county criminal court 10 ill be voting for tonya roland mclaughlin this was not an easy decision her opponent dan spjut is very well qualified and as you will see below has a unique story in the end it was a difference in our vision of judicial practice that swayed my vote to mclaughlin dan is a native of houston is married to judge elsa alcala and has three children he joined the houston police department at the age of 20 and had a distinguished 27 year career which included stints as an undercover officer in the joint intelligence center with the fbi served on a special unit investigating other police officers the gang division and narcotics while working full time at hpd dan received his undergraduate degree from the university of houston and his law degree from the south texas college of law after his retirement from hpd in 2007 he opened a private practice representing juveniles that have gotten in trouble he has a long history of working in republican circles and has received the endorsements county commissioners radack and cagle representative allen fletcher hpou police inc and the three major slates hotze lowry and polland click here to view his conservative coalition of harris county questionnaire tonya was born in linden texas and is married to reid who is a financial advisor she received her undergraduate degree from texas state university and her law degree from south texas college of law after graduation from south texas she went to work at the harris county district attorneys office after a relatively short stint as an ada in 2009 she left to open her own criminal defense practice because she wanted more opportunity and to be her own boss she has received endorsements from united republicans the cclub texas conservative view spring branch republicans the houston chronicle and kingwood tea party click here to view her conservative coalition of harris county questionnaire as with all campaigns supporters of each candidate have their reasons for not wanting the other person the main charge that ive heard against spjut from the mclaughlin supporters is that he is not qualified they base this charge on the fact that spjut practices juvenile law and cc10 is a misdemeanor criminal court in fact mclaughlin features this charge on her website tonya rolland mclaughlin isnt just the most qualified candidate in this race  shes the only qualified candidate houston chronicle i fell for that one during the first round endorsing mclaughlin largely because everyone was repeating that after interviewing spjut and doing a bit of research i find that charge to be false the idea that a 27 year veteran of hpd who has had his bar card 15 years and has represented criminal juvenile defendants for 7 of those years in his own practice isnt qualified to be a judge of a misdemeanor criminal court is ludicrous click here to read don hoopers excellent analysis of what a county criminal court does the other charge from the mclaughlin supporters is that spjut was a no show at most grassroot events during the primary that one is very much true but it isnt because he wasnt interested in meeting with activists  he was actually balancing his family life and paying attention to his children as i noted above his wife is judge elsa alcala judge alcala is on the texas court of criminal appeals which is the highest court in texas for criminal appeals she works in austin four days a week and spjut chose to remain involved in his childrens activities rather than dump them off to relatives or care givers i think that anyone should be commended for putting their children first about the only charges ive heard from spjut supporters about mclaughlin is that she didnt fulfill her three year commitment to the district attorneys office and that she is overall too young on the first charge yes that is true but largely irrelevant to voters and on the second charge that is also true but voters in harris county have accepted young judges before with good results  judge ryan patrick comes to mind if you look at her success as an ada and as a criminal defense attorney i think that she is more in the mold of judge patrick than some wideeyed kid ah here is the tough one i thought it was interesting that when i asked the question how do you want to be remembered when you leave the bench both candidates said essentially the same thing  as a judge who was fair  treated everyone the same and pursued justice one of the traits of being a longtime police officer is that you become jaded and tend to think that if someone is arrested they are probably guilty and after talking to spjut i think he falls into this category it would be hard not to after what he saw during his undercover days during our interview he told me a couple of things that led me to this conclusion the first was that the reason he chose to do juvenile law was that there was no possible way that he could be a criminal defense attorney after what he saw as a cop fair enough i think that statement in and of itself wouldnt disqualify him from being a judge but voters should be aware of it the second thing was more direct and the reason that i am choosing to vote for his opponent i asked him what he thought a conservative philosophy for a criminal court meant he related that during his early days as an officer the courts were dominated by democratic party judges some of those judges believed the defendant over the word of the officers this is a direct quote from that conversation you have to give more weight to the professional that is just doing his job i mean i have no reason to lie and say it was this guys or that guys dope  i just think some of those judges feel so sorry or for whatever reason they just want to give the defendants every possible break they can and to me if youve made a correct case a legal case you just follow the law some of you might agree with his philosophy giving more weight to the professional and not giving any breaks to defendants i think that the system is so stacked against defendants and that there have been enough cases of professionals not telling the truth that we need judges who will not automatically accept the professionals testimony at face value but are willing to probe and allow for the possibility that the professional does have an agenda and while i fully believe spjut when he says he wants to be remembered as fair i think that even he may not realize how hard that will be for him to do so there you go my vote goes to tonya rolland mclaughlin

Debbie Riddle needs your help to combat housing projects in your neighborhood         	2013-05-22	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://blog.chron.com/bigjolly/2013/05/rep-debbie-riddle-needs-your-help-to-combat-housing-projects-in-your-neighborhood/	en	  representative debbie riddle representative debbie riddle is one of those politicians with whom i agree about 80 of the time when shes wrong in my opinion i let it be known and when shes right shes right and im willing to help her in any way i can and by golly big jolly shes right when it comes to hb3361 the sunset bill for the texas department of housing and community affairs its sort of complicated but ill try to lay it out if someone wants to build a government housing project in your neighborhood one of the points that the tdhca had to take into consideration is the local state representatives or state senators viewpoints be it positive or negative representative riddle has been a fierce opponent of these projects in her district and has been quite effective at keeping them out  when hb3361 was originally filed by representative harold dutton and the companion in the senate sb214 by senator brian birdwell it removed the ability of the local state repsenator to affect the decision process representative riddle was able to get this requirement back into the bill by amending it making it optional for the local repsenator to weigh in if they chose not to other criteria could be used in their place when the bill was approved by the house as amended and sent to the senate senator birdwell substituted his original version eliminating the ability of the local repsenator to have a say in the process yes it allows them so send in a letter but removes their viewpoint from the actual scoring system in my opinion that is a terrible idea but it sailed through the senate with hardly a blip my senator senator larry taylor tried to amend it to allow the local state rep to have input but found no support and withdrew his amendment so now it heads to a conference committee to hash out the differences ive taken a snapshot of the relevant differences between the two versions from the senate analysis click to enlarge  representative riddle is pleading for citizens to call senator birdwell senator dan patrick and their state representatives and lobby them to allow their local repssenators to have the ability to affect the outcome of decisions on where to place government housing projects she has taken to facebook to keep us apprised of the situation and in typical riddle fashion is loud and forceful in her arguments here are a few of her comments note these are taken from several days worth of her updates alert the biggest fight i have had and continue to have this legislative session is about the low income housing apartment projects that try to come into your neighborhoods for the 11 years i have been in office i have fought these projects yesterday senator birdwell r passed his bill that would eliminate the point system and the ability for me or your state rep and your state senator to object or approve these projects to take away my voice takes away the voice of the people in my district senator larry taylorr introduced an amendment to continue the point system and allow the state representatives to have a voice not one senator  not even one  stood with senator taylor this is so sad it is so bad for our communities  i have kept some really bad actors out on the other had i fought hard for a project for seniors only in the aldine westfield area of my district that the folks really wanted now unless we can win the battle in conference committee your voice will be silenced about how your tax money is being used regarding what is brought into your neighborhood to over crowd your schools cause more traffic increase crime and stress the emergency services and police let your state representative know how you feel about this representative harold dutton d has been my hero in this fight please thank representative harold dutton d who has taken a brave stand against having our voice silenced and has fought this battle with me side by side representative representative sylvestor turner d and representative patricia harless r and representative allen fletcher r have been fight this battle with me this is not about party  it is about allowing the voice of the people to he taken seriously or causing the voice of the people to be silenced this silences all the state reps  not just me  this silences all the people of texas pray that we will be victorious in the conference committee  call your state reps and your state senators and let them know that if they silence your voice  you will silence theirs in the next election help us in this fight  make your voice known share this on your fb page  this is important for all the folks in texas debbie riddle james it is a republican senator who is silencing your voice  his name is senator birdwell r  it is a d harold dutton d who is fighting to keep our voice heard this is not about party these low income housing builders are very wealthy and very powerful  this is a serious fight  let your state reps know where your stand and let your senators know how you feel again not one senator  not even one  republican or democrat stood with senator larry taylor and his amendment that would allow the point system and our voice continue to be hard session ends may 27  we are at the end of this fight and we must win  this is serious let the folks from the governor office on down know who you are and know that you vote debbie riddle james and mark and chris  i am saying senator larry taylor is the only senator who stood up for us on this issue and received no support from anyone else if the senators do not want to be part of the conversation about low income housing  that is ok  just do not take my voice away as a state representative most of the other state reps say the same thing this the tdhca sunset bill tdhca is tx dept of housing and community affairs this fight is not new  but this is the worst one yet on this issue  and if we do not win it will be bad news for all the good folks of texas senator birdwell cussed me out on the floor of the senate bold added for emphasis because he got some calls from my district  odd how some senators resent hearing from tax payers debbie riddle max please understand this is not an r d issue  the three that have stood at my side on this are ds and a number of rs but it is a senate full of rs that are stripping away our voice debbie riddle connie birdwell and the senators have large districts  and to get in the business of fighting these low income housing apartment projects can be time consuming and difficult  i do not have a problem with that  however i do have a problem with their taking away our ability to have the voice of the people we represent as state representative and they do that when they remove our ability to write letters positively or negatively that connie is the problem larry taylors amendment was a good compromise and a solution  all the other senators rejected the idea debbie riddle susan birdwell iis a fine american and an honorable man  however he fundamentally believes that state reps and state senators should have no voice in this issue he is only in his second session  i have been fighting this battle for 11 years  i think he does not fully understand the issuel gerry daly antonini i have contacted senator patrick he supports the change that this bill brings he said that the scoring letter will come from the local commissioners city council or whatever the local governing body is and not state representatives and senators i dont know what that means in the effort to stop this project probably not going to help us what else can be done if the bill is made law lamar casparis debbie please talk to dan he sees it differently believing that even though the reps loose the points which i dont like more representation will occur locally im not close enough to the proposed legislation to know the end effect but i want you to be involved and want your voice to count debbie riddle lamar i spoke with dan  turning it over to the county commissioners is not making it more local  all of us state reps live in our districts no county commissioner lives in my district or even close to my district nobody knows my district better than me  i live there passing the buck and passing the responsibility will not work and does not work debbie riddle lamar i am working on a solution  but birdwell who is only in his second legislative session is holding us hostage and says he will not budge we are willing to let the senate take themselves out of the situation of writing a letter for or against with points but leave the house alone he wants to dictate to both i am still working i did try to contact senator birdwell through the standard email form on his state website since i dont know him and do not live in his district i didnt expect a reply and didnt get one i was surprised that he would curse out representative riddle on the senate floor and dan has been too busy for me to bother with him on this one so i gave him a break and didnt call but i hope that speaker straus puts together a conference committee that understands representative riddles concerns and i will contact representative john davis and senator larry taylor in hopes that they can help her this one is still winnable folks hey if you want one of these projects in your neighborhood then you can have them and your state rep should be able to help you get them or in my case i dont want them in my neighborhood and my state rep should be able to help me stop them senator birdwells largest urban area if you can call it that is waco he has no idea of the types of problems we face in harris county with these huge crime centers representative debbie riddle is right  lets help her in this fight call today

                          Texas Senate touts pig as lipstick         	2013-05-01	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://blog.chron.com/bigjolly/2013/05/texas-senate-touts-pig-as-lipstick/	en	in what is becoming commonplace for the 83rd session the texas senate passed sb1907 a bill by senator glenn hegar r18 that would allow students to have guns on near um no how about far far away from their persons while on campus from claire cardona in the dallas morning news   senators voted tuesday to allow students to keep guns in their cars on college campuses after democrats sought and received assurances that the measure wouldnt be broadened to allow concealed handguns to be carried at universities the bill would grant students who have concealedhandgun licenses the ability to store their guns legally in their cars on streets and in parking lots at institutions of higher education no college public or private would be able to opt out which they currently are allowed to do senator glenn hegar the measures author pledged to keep his bill limited keeping firearms locked out of sight out of mind is the only thing i want to pass to the governors desk said hegar rkaty campus carry is not this legislation i dont want that on here this is a totally different issue  the measure passed on a 274 vote with eight democrats joining the chambers 19 republicans it now goes to the house democrats have long been concerned about allowing concealed handgun license holders to bring guns into classrooms something that many university administrators oppose the chairman of the senate criminal justice committee democrat john whitmire of houston said his committee would not consider such a bill and like clockwork the harris county republican party took to facebook to sing the praises of senator hegar but the comments tell you what people really think cecelia ferry peterson ok criminals just hold on a sec while just run to my car and get the means to defend myself smh one word lubys ed sarlls iii next year increased vehicular burglaries in college parking lots ann pavalock this is progress what no not good enough i avoid as much as possible those establishments that prohibit guns now how many places is that well my doctors office for one my grand childrens school the post office and all hospitals not easy to do by any means wont shop at ace hardware because there is a post office in the store this isnt campus carry and it isnt anything to be proud of recall that lieutenant governor dewhurst shipped the real campus carry bill to senator john whitmire to be bottled up and put in the trash bin senate criminal justice committee chairman john whitmire dhouston has left the campus carry bill written by representative brian birdwell rgranbury hanging since january he said he doesnt intend to schedule it for a hearing the texas house is having a little bit better luck with representative allen fletchers r130 hb972 which he moved out of committee and is now scheduled for a vote by the full house via aps jim vertuno the calendars committee scheduled the floor vote for saturday in the house getting the bill even that far is a significant development for supporters of an issue that erupted into one of the most contentious of the session two years ago in 2011 the issue died without a vote in the house despite a majority of member signing on in support this year the house version of the bill would eliminate the current ban on concealed weapons at colleges and universities but it still allows public schools to ban weapons if they first meet with students faculty and staff to consider their input private schools would be allowed to opt in representative dan flynn rvan one of the primary authors of the bill said the optout language has softened opposition from higher education officials who worry that allowing guns on campus will increase campus violence and suicide he said he expects the house will approve it but declined to discuss its prospects in the senate i think it will pass in the house flynn said monday texas is a rural state  most of the opposition has been in austin  the house bill has severe flaws but is far better than the mush coming out of the senate in related news we get reports of the highcrime university of houston  texas southern university area via robert stanton in the houston chronicle coming in at no 15 in the us is a houston neighborhood centered at the intersection of dowling and mcgowen streets located in houstons historic third ward  a broad geographical area that includes stately mansions the university of houston and texas southern university the violent crime rate per 1000 is reported as 7589 and residents there have a 1 in 13 chance of becoming a victim of crime in one year the problem with the house bill is that it allows universities to optout which makes the left giddy and scares the bejabbers out of the students that have to tell criminals to wait a minute while i run to the parking lot and get my weapon where have all the republicans gone in relatedrelated news dont forget that jerry patterson is in houston tomorrow

                          Texas cops often can't take guns from mentally ill         	2013-03-03	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://www.chron.com//life/healthzone/article/Texas-cops-often-can-t-take-guns-from-mentally-ill-4326096.php	en	houston ap  texas police often cant keep guns from the mentally ill because they dont have the authority under state law to seize a weapon from someone they are transporting for evaluation at a psychiatric treatment center houston police chief charles mcclelland wants the legislature to require a judge to decide if those who have been referred for mental health treatment are qualified to possess a gun hes enlisted state representative allen fletcher a republican from tomball who is drafting a bill to keep those firearms in a police property room until a judge decides it should be returned right now state law only allows police to keep weapons used in the commission of a crime im not trying to take guns from citizens in this country but there should be an additional judicial review mcclelland tells the houston chronicle httpbitly13yq8fs  someone other than the police should have to review that case or that incident requiring that mental evaluation to tell me if this person is still qualified to own or carry a firearm and get it back when houston police officers respond to a call involving a mentally disturbed person they sometimes find the suspect armed with the same gun they seized in an earlier incident last year houston police had 27000 calls involving residents with mental health problems and seized 47 firearms from january to july from persons taken for mental examination in 2011 the 25000 mental health calls handled by houston police included 90 people whose firearms were held while they were given an emergency psychiatric exam mcclelland said that because of the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 police dont know if the person was committed for psychiatric treatment whenever that persons mental evaluation is completed because of hipaa laws and medical privacy issues i have no way of knowing if this person still qualifies to carry or have a firearm mcclelland said but when they show up at the property room i have no choice but to give it back and i want to give it back if they still qualify  the proposed legislation would amend the states mental health code allowing police to hold a weapon taken from a person who is experiencing a mental health crisis and has been found to be a danger to himself or others and is being transported by police for an emergency mental health evaluation the bill sets deadlines for returning the firearm if the individuals are no longer legally allowed to own a weapon they can transfer it to a designee police are not allowed to keep or destroy weapons not claimed but instead must sell them and give the proceeds to the owner san antonio police chief bill mcmanus offered support for the change in law my stance on gun laws is not a political one mcmanus said in a statement i am a proponent of any law that keeps guns out of the hands of people who shouldnt have them and any law which enhances public safety and officer safety  fletcher a retired houston police officer and hostage negotiator who is vice chairman of the house public safety committee recalled taking a weapon from a suspect only to return to the same address and face the same disturbed person who retrieved the firearm from the property room  information from houston chronicle httpwwwhoustonchroniclecom
                          On city delegations and firefighter pensions         	2013-03-01	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://blog.chron.com/kuffsworld/2013/03/on-city-delegations-and-firefighter-pensions/	en	there are two points of interest in this chron editorial about the legislature and the desire of the city to get a bill passed that would give it some leverage over the firefighters in their fight over the pension fund sometimes we wonder if there really is such a thing as a houston delegation representing our citys interests in the texas legislature this is one of those moments with the deadline for filing bills coming in a legislative heartbeat on march 8 no representative or senator from houston has stepped up to carry legislation dealing with what is without question the most important issue facing our city in austin were speaking of a bill that would once and for all get city pension matters out of the legislatures hands and return them to local control failure of a single lawmaker with houston behind his or her name to take this step is a deep disappointment the failure of any of our representatives to do so for the second session in a row borders on political malfeasance shame the inability of the city to have the right of meet and confer with representatives of the firefighters pension fund leaves our leaders literally flying blind in estimating the amounts owed by city taxpayers to fund the firefighters pensions enabling legislation granting meet and confer with the firefighters is the essential first step in effectively managing the longterm funding obligations of the city to this group with the firefighters continuing to enjoy the privilege of withholding pension fund information from city officials the best mayor parker and other leaders can hope for is an uneasy truce with municipal employees and houston police officers whose pension boards have agreed to meet and confer and changed their benefits at least through meet and confer with the other employee groups the city has been able to provide sustainable benefit structures for future and recently hired employees im not going to get into the merits or demerits of such legislation ive talked about it plenty  see here here here and here for a sample  and will undoubtedly talk more about it in the future but note the bit about the march 8 deadline for filing legislation if the kind of bill the chron wants does not get filed by then thats it for two years what that means in particular is that as we enter the city of houston election season anyone who talks about the need to control pension costs without acknowledging the legislative aspect of it and the need to find someone to author or sponsor a bill is someone who shouldnt be taken seriously again im not taking a position here on the wisdom of this approach just pointing out the legal realities this is a legislative issue first tell me what you would do about that then ill listen when you want to talk about what you would do when and if that obstacle is removed if youre not even aware that there is an obstacle then the rest of what you have to say isnt important anyway the other point is this  there are 37 people representing houston in austin  29 in the texas house of representatives and eight in the texas senate i stared at that list for a few minutes trying to figure out how they came up with it the list contains all 24 members of the harris county delegation three of the four members from fort bend all but phil stephenson and two of the three from montgomery county cecil bell and steve toth but not brandon creighton its true that the city of houston extends into those other counties but the footprint in each is small in the 2012 election 998 votes were cast in montgomery county for the city of houston bond propositions this represents less than 06 of the 175419 total votes in montgomery county in fort bend 9304 votes were cast out of 222626 total which is 41 we also know that there are a total of 21504 voters in the relevant precincts and 341523 total voters or 63 point being the reach of houston into these counties is quite limited im pretty sure only toth whose district is on the south end of montgomery and ron reynolds actually have houston voters as constituents it turns out that the chron complied this list the way that i would have if i had no other information available to me and wanted to take a stab at figuring out who represents houston they simply went to the find your representative query on the texas house webpage filled in houston for the city and then alphabetized the result without giving the matter any further thought if i were to ask olivia to research the question and she came back with this answer id tell her she did a good job getting this far id also tell her that we could refine the result and come up with a more appropriate list it might occur to you for example that harris county is roughly twice the population of houston surely there are a few reps whose districts fall entirely within the nonhouston parts of harris county how could one tell well one could check harris county precinct results from the 2012 elections to see which state rep districts contained no votes for the houston bond propositions and guess what i already did that work for you state rep districts 128 wayne smith 130 allen fletcher 135 gary elkins and 150 debbie riddle lie entirely outside the city limits of houston if anyone took up the chrons call to action after reading this editorial it would be completely appropriate for them to say in response that this was none of their concern in fact thats the response id want them to give since they dont actually represent any houston voters districts 126 patricia harless 132 bill callegari and 144 mary ann perez have minimal overlap with houston if any of them declined to get involved on the grounds that they have higher priorities for their districts and constituents i would not blame them that reduces the houston delegation down to 19 in the house as for the senate i didnt do this analysis for senate districts back then and frankly i dont feel like doing it now id be pretty confident about excluding sens glenn hegar and tommy williams from the houston list and id note that about twothirds of larry taylors voters live in galveston and brazoria counties that takes our size38 delegation down to 24 and it didnt take me very long to figure that out why the chron didnt take a few more minutes to do the same is a question i cant answer

                          Group wants signs honoring Reagan up along US 290         	2012-02-28	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://www.chron.com//neighborhood/cyfair-news/article/Group-wants-signs-honoring-Reagan-up-along-U-S-3367486.php	en	a new nonprofit organization was created in february to raise 24000 needed to erect two signs officially designating us 290 as the ronald reagan memorial highway it has been seven years since a stretch of the highway in harris county has been renamed in honor of the nations 40th president ronald reagan yet highway signs have remained unchanged state representative dwayne bohac rhouston who authored legislation in 2005 renaming a substantial portion of houstons northwest freeway after the famed republican president is asking private sector companies and citizens to donate money to finally replace two signs along the highway with ones reflecting the name change according to the legislation authorizing the name change the signage changes are not to be paid with public dollars house bill 540 requires the texas department of transportation to construct and erect the new highway signs reflecting the name change only when the agency receives enough private donations to cover the costs in the spirit of president reagans belief in the private sector the texas legislature trusted that patriotic citizens would come together to make this a reality bohac said plus im very cheap and i dont think this is something the government should fund  according to reaganhighwayorg the funds official website two green and white 85foot by 185foot signs would be constructed to indicate the highway number along with the new name designation the first phase of the project is to raise 12000 to place a highway marker at the westbound us 290 and beltway 8 interchange the second phase of the signage project is also estimated to cost 12000 and would place the highway marker at the eastbound us 290 harris countywaller county line several elected officials bohac said have already contributed about 12000 to the nonprofit fund those wishing to donate money to the memorial highway project may visit the funds website donations online can be made via credit card or electronic check in any amount donations may also be set up as single or recurring contributions bohac officially kicked off the nonprofit funding project last month in honor of what would have been reagans 101st birthday and said he hopes to have the signs built and erected by the end of this year bohac said state senator dan patrick rhouston and state representative allen fletcher rtomball are joining him in promoting the memorial highway fund across harris county any funds raised above the 24000 needed for the signs will be used to finance other projects along the memorial highway such as landscaping bohac said he also would like to see a mural in honor of reagan designed on an underpass i am honored to launch this collaborative effort to complete the ronald reagan memorial highway project bohac said during these challenging times for our country it is fitting to pay tribute to one of our strongest leaders who inspired true hope  reagan who served two terms as president for most of the 1980s has been one of americas strongest leaders who inspired true hope bohac said he said anyone regardless of the political isle they are on should be encouraged to donate regans support transcended political boundaries as evidenced by his electoral support he said he was a universally transcendent figure that comes around rarely in our political lifetime  reagan is one of three men in the state representatives life that inspired bohacs own life when bohac was 26 years old he got to spend about 20 minutes with reagan it was the early 1990s right after the president retired in los angeles he said it was just really a terrific experience for me  bohac even named his son reagan after the president who died in 2004 after president reagans death that was probably one of the most popular names bohac said i think every class my son has been in since he has been going to school there have been probably two or three reagans both females and males  bohac wants those who travel the highway to remember how great america can be and to be encouraged to always travel down the road of liberty opportunity and prosperity ideals he said reagan spoke about during one his last speeches made in houston during a republican political convention held in 1992 linda dewhurst a republican party political activist and founder of the daughters of liberty republican women serves on the ronald reagan memorial highway funds board of directors when she first heard of the move to rename the highway in honor of reagan dewhurst said she knew she wanted to get involved she is promoting the project to her friends and social network helping to bring in donations i just have a lot of respect for ronald reagan she said he had a lot to do with me ever getting interested in and following politics at all when he was running for president in the 1980s he really spoke to my heart  dewhurst said reagans conservative ideals are timeless and just as important today as they were when he was running for president  even before he was running for president he ran ads on the radio that just talked about our country and what it stands for and what is great about it she said he was such an optimist i think when people see his name it will bring back those thoughts there are people who still value that character and that impression of our country i think the signs will be an affirmation to people when they see his name up there  allen jones is a freelance writer and can

district board of trustees responded to a questionnaire from the ultimate cyfair section the candidates and their responses are listed in alphabetical order personal information james hardin 56 and his wife barbara a former teacher and substitute in cyfair isd for 19 years have two children lindsey 17 and tyler 14 both at cypress ranch high school a 1978 graduate of texas am university hardin has owned a commercial landscape corporation in cyfair for more than 28 years christine hartley 43  and her husband jay have three children shana a freshman at cypress ranch high school hayden a seventhgrader at salyards middle school and brennan a secondgrader at swenke elementary school a graduate of cypress creek high school hartley holds a bachelors degree in elementary education from louisiana state university and a masters degree in early childhood education with a minor in administration from the university of north texas she works as a preschool teacher at fairfield baptist church and is a parent volunteer ethel wolfe 64 and her husband bob an elected trustee for the lone star college system have two grown sons mike a trustee for the harris county department of education and jeff who graduated from cypress creek high school in 2003 wolfe holds a bachelors degree in english with a minor in sociology from the university of tennessee and two masters degrees one in counseling  and one in religious education both from southwestern baptist theological seminary she works as an english teacher at lamar high school in the houston independent school district and previously worked as a caseworker for child welfare and for the food stamp office and as assistant director of fletcher street mission center why are you running for trustee hardin we need to support the teachers more funding needs to be directed to the classroom as well as supporting teachers with discipline issues next i believe we need to take care of the community by not overtaxing families cannot afford this in these economic times finally i care about the businesses in our district we need to bring in more business to the community to develop revenue and connect businesses with our schools i feel with my 28 years of business experience my community involvement and volunteering in our schools i bring leadership to the table  hartley as a parent of three daughters who attend cyfair schools i am concerned with the future of the cypress fairbanks independent school district during the past nine years i have spent countless hours volunteering in the schools as well as time committed to district committees i have seen how the budget cuts have affected the resources to the classroom the saving grace throughout this time period has been the outstanding and qualified staff that cfisd maintains i am seeking a seat on the board of trustees to insure that the quality education and efficient handling of funds is maintained wolfe as a teacher and as a cyfair mom grandma homemaker and ronald reagan conservative i was first elected to the cyfair school board in 2008 with more than 45000 votes and more than 57 percent of the vote because i want to protect the homestead exemption in cyfair and keep a low tax rate but i also know the importance of a good education i carry my conservative outlook and all of my experiences with me to every board meeting i am a strong and effective voice for the hardworking citizens of our school district what solutions do you advocate to make state funding of education more equitable should the district continue to offer the optional 20 percent homestead exemption why or why not hardin yes the 20 percent homestead should be kept as texans we have always considered our house as our homestead since the present form of school funding is broken and really has never worked it should be abolished also it should be understood that the mandates coming from the state legislature upon the schools are causing a funding shortage those mandates not deemed necessary should be abolished to save funding for more important programs within the school finally since the texas constitution believes that public education is necessary for all texans then it only makes sense that all texans take part in the funding of the school system i believe that a sales tax phased in to replace school property tax would be fair to all citizens then it is up to the legislature to come up with a fair equitable plan for all hartley all students in harris county are expected to pass the same standardized tests but does the money given to school districts in the county reflect the same expectation no as a board member i plan to make sure that legislators hear from us politicians in austin have failed to provide adequate funding for cyfair isd we shouldnt be asked to do without appropriate funds we shouldnt ever have to consider giving up the optional homestead exemption homeowners in the district must become engaged in the process and voice their frustration if we are to protect our property values wolfe as a wife mother and grandmother i know the importance of cyfairs full homestead exemption as a teacher and as an elected school trustee i also know that cfisd must learn to live within its budget and that means a budget that includes the full homestead exemption we can provide more classroom resources by cutting the number of assistant superintendents and other administrators throughout the school system we can stop building colossal 80 million buildings like the berry center and start putting that type of money where it really belongs we need to look to leaders like state board of education member terri leo and state legislators like senator dan patrick and state representatives gary elkins allen fletcher patricia harless dwayne bohac debbie riddle and others along with the governor and lieutenant governor to work toward a sensible solution to make state funding of education more equitable in 201011 45 percent of the districts enrollment was classified as economically disadvantaged what programs or resources do you use to make sure all students can succeed academically hardin we must maintain high educational and behavioral expectations all students are valued and can learn we can continue in programs such as read 180 which is a reading intervention program for students reading below proficiency i believe in continuing with programs such as saturday campslabs not all students have the means for being picked up from the school therefore transportation is needed i would like to see late buses provided for afterschool tutorials students should be exposed to a variety of experiences in the classroom since many have not had the opportunity to visit various fine art establishments teachers need to continue to build relationships with the parents so there is the athome support hartley yes the district demographics are rapidly changing the key part of the equation remains the teachers and staff we must maintain highly qualified employees in order to best serve our students we must look at how larger classes affect our students performance in addition we must pay attention to the district as a whole and not focus solely on our individual schools adoption of schools by businesses and churches are seeing great success in financial aid but more importantly volunteers who are serving as mentors to students and are providing the support for education that many children desire wolfe every student enrolled in cfisd must receive the needed support to succeed academically whether they take advantage of afterschool tutoring additional resources available to the economically disadvantaged such as head start school meals etc we as a district and as a community must rally together to lift all of our kids up in this hard economic time exponential growth in cfisd is bringing this issue to the forefront now more than ever as a former caseworker for both child welfare and for the food stamp office helping families with dependent children and as a current teacher myself i know the pain and problems present in the lives of kids from disadvantaged homes we must encourage parental involvement and make families aware of the assistance that is available not only from cfisd but also from harris county as well as the state and federal governments

honored for his moneyfinding ability during the precincts 20th annual awards banquet held june 24 at shirley acres in houston it takes a lot to go out and get these grants cannon said it takes a lot of research and time monitoring various grants and keeping up with the paperwork process the funds helped us purchase a lot of equipment in a much needed time  law enforcement is not just about making arrests and serving warrants it is also about balancing budgets and finding funds to purchase office equipment lease workspace and operate training programs finding additional funds can be a difficult task especially when having to cut 7 million out of an agencys budget  a task precinct 4 underwent earlier this year in addition to having 99 jobs cut from the precincts force the remaining 415 employees received a 3 percent reduction in pay administrators also saved money by ending contracts to staff school districts within the precincts boundaries among the grant monies cannon obtained

grants alone totaled 500000 the assistant chief also worked with the 100 club of houston to obtain more than 35000 to purchase a firearms training simulator cannon also worked to obtain a 30000squarefoot office space at 330 meadowfern for little cost to the precinct he worked with the harris county toll road authority which provided 100000 to help facilitate the move to the new office cannon also coordinated efforts among all harris county constable offices to obtain a 400000 grant used for the completion of the harris county ecitation project which allows for the use of electronic transmission of reports or tickets for court processing after the budget cut to the precinct i knew i had to find ways to supplement the funds we lost he said most of the money came through grants which come down through the federal government  cannon said he is worried that some of the grants may not be available next year however a lot of things just happened for us this year at a time when we really needed the assistance he said im proud to be able to help the department out  the awards ceremony is held each year to recognize fulltime officers and reserve officers for outstanding

                          How liberal or conservative is your state rep?         	2011-07-12	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://blog.chron.com/bakerblog/2011/07/how-liberal-or-conservative-is-your-state-rep/	en	 some rights reserved by frank jaquier ccbysa political scientists have long used roll call votes cast by members of the us congress to plot the legislators on the liberalconservative dimension along which most legislative politics in our nations capitol as well as in austin now takes place here drawing on all 999 nonlopsided roll call votes held during the combined 2011 regular and first special legislative sessions i provide similar information for the members of the texas house of representatives with particular focus on the 37 representatives from the 10county houston metropolitan region details on the methodology employed for the analysis and coding are provided here this analysis allows us to rank in order all of the members of the texas house of representatives from most liberal 1 to most conservative 149 based on their roll call vote behavior as well as to compare members of the each party with each other ie democrats to other democrats and republicans to other republicans in the latter case we can assess the extent to which specific democrats are more or less liberal than their colleagues and the degree to which specific republicans are more or less conservative than the other members of the republican delegation in all cases it is important to keep in mind that this methodology is based entirely on the representatives observed roll call vote behavior and does not take into account the myriad of other activities which are much more difficult if not impossible in many cases to reliably observe legislators engage in every texas house democrat is significantly more liberal than every texas house republican during 2011 compared to the whole texas house democratic party delegation the 14strong houstonarea democratic party delegation is noticeably liberal in its voting behavior with nine houston democrats among the partys more liberal members but only two among its more conservative members the complete data and rankings for all 149 texas house members can be found here the most liberal representative in the houston area delegation is jessica farrar followed immediately by armando walle farrars voting record on the house floor in 2011 locates her as the fourth most liberal member of the texas house and significantly more liberal than 29 of her 48 democratic colleagues not to mention all 100 republicans speaker joe straus does not normally cast roll call votes walle was the fifth most liberal representative in the 2011 texas house and noticeably more liberal than 25 of his fellow democrats another group seven total ranging from ana hernandez luna as the eighth most liberal to boris miles as the 21st most liberal occupies the remaining portion of the liberal side of the democratic partys liberalconservative spectrum within the party local legislators senfronia thompson ranked 26th hubert vo 28th and alma allen 29th find themselves in the center in the more conservative wing of the party are only two area democrats scott hochberg in the 31st position and craig eiland eiland is the legislatures third most conservative democrat 46th and possesses a voting record that places him as significantly more conservative than all but seven of his 48 democratic copartisans the 23member houstonarea republican delegation roughly reflects the statewide delegation in terms of its ideological diversity at the conservative end of the spectrum ranked 141st randy weber is the ninth most conservative member of the texas house and the most conservative houstonarea representative with a voting record that is significantly more conservative than that of 73 of his fellow 99 republican house members following weber among the most conservative republicans are brandon creighton 139th james white 135th ken legler 133rd dennis bonnen 129th allen fletcher 123rd and william callegari 120th a large contingent of houstonarea republicans is located within the ideological center of the republican party note this does not signify that these representatives are necessarily ideologically moderate rather only that they are in the middle of the ideological road among texas house republicans in 2011 this ninemember group ranges from debbie riddle 113th to larry taylor 86th the final group of area republicans has voting records that make them more moderate than between onethird and a little more than twothirds of their fellow house republicans it is crucial to recall that the broader interparty data indicate that not a single texas republican house member is a liberal  in fact the least conservative texas house republican aaron pea of edinburg is substantially more conservative than the most conservative house democrat tracy king of batesville the chasm that divides the two parties in the texas house can be graphically seen in this figure however these data do indicate that the members of this final group especially those in the second subgroup are significantly more moderate in terms of their ideological roll call voting record than a noteworthy share of their fellow house republicans the first subgroup consists of a set of legislators including john otto 77th sarah davis 75th beverly woolley 70th wayne smith 69th and john otto 68th who are more moderate than at least onethird but less than onehalf of their republican colleagues the two most moderate republicans in the houston area are rob eissler 54th and john davis 53rd only recent partyswitchers aaron pea 2010 allan ritter of nederland 2010 and charles chuck hopson of jacksonville 2009 have less conservative voting records than davis and eissler within the republican caucus davis voting record is significantly less conservative than 81 of his fellow republicans while eisslers is significantly less conservative than 79 overall a wide range of ideological perspectives are represented by the houstonarea texas house delegation with the very liberal jessica farrar balanced by the very conservative randy weber at opposing ends of the liberalconservative dimension this variation is also present at the intraparty level especially within the republican party where coexisting within the regions republican delegation were representatives who are among the state partys most conservative eg randy weber and brandon creighton and least conservative john davis rob eissler members analysis of the data focusing on the entire state can be found in this texas tribune article mark p jones is the james a baker iii institute for public policys fellow in political science as well as the joseph d jamail chair in latin american studies and chair of the department of political science at rice university
