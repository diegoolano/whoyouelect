                          Wife of campaign manager for Houston ISD trustees president Paula Harris does $75K in no-bid consulting ...  	2011-06-29	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://blog.chron.com/newswatch/2011/06/wife-of-houston-isd-trustees-president-paula-harris-campaign-manager-does-75k-in-no-bid-consulting-for-hisd/	en	by lynn walsh and jennifer peebles texas watchdog the houston school system has paid the wife of the school board presidents campaign treasurer 75000 in nobid work over the last two years as a consultant arranging classes and afterschool programs on subjects including cpr english as a second language jazz dance and parenting demetra c jones the wife of prominent houston lawyer franklin dr frank jones jr and her businesses have been paid 78110 by the houston independent school district since 2009 records released by the school system show frank jones is the campaign treasurer for paula harris who was elected to the hisd trustees in 2007 and who became the trustees president in january frank jones has also done legal work for the houston schools including serving as lead negotiator for the school district when it hired current superintendent terry grier away from the san diego calif schools two years ago demetra jones is the former longtime head of human resources and risk management for harris county precinct one working under county commissioner el franco lee for two decades she previously served as office manager in city hall for state senator rodney ellis when he was a houston city councilman some 20 years ago and was public affairs manager for ellis houston investment bank apex securities according to two resumes available online she has a masters degree in education from the university of houston and she has taught in the past at both u of h and lone star college her resumes said d jones  none of the work done by demetra jones and her firms was subjected to competitive bidding and none of it was ever subjected to a vote by the hisd trustees individual school principals and hisd department heads made the decision to hire jones firms a district spokesman said trustees votes arent required for individual consultant agreements worth less than 25000 each or less than 100000 in the aggregate hisd spokesman jason spencer said in an email a formal requestforproposal process is not required for hiring educational consultants records show the work done by jones companies was billed in dozens of separate expenses of usually several hundred dollars or a couple thousand dollars at a time the services were requested in accordance with current procedures spencer said the school district put the amount paid to the jones businesses at 74700 demetra jones did not return phone messages left for her by texas watchdog frank jones did not return phone messages or an email for comment hisd needs to have an armslength policy between their board and their contractors or vendors said andy wilson with public citizen of texas it may be that jones was the most qualified person to run these programs  but when shes awarded a nobid contract and has financial and political ties to the chair the public is going to catch a whiff of that and be outraged this could be innocent but theres no way to be certain between this and other recent issues hisd needs to take a good hard look at rewriting their ethics rules especially in our schools and especially in this budget crisis where dollars are so precious we need to insure our school money is going to the most qualified lowest cost people not the politically or financially connected ones  the revelation of jones work for hisd makes her the second close friend of harris found to have been paid thousands of dollars by the school system for nobid work texas watchdog has previously reported that hisd paid companies connected to pearland businesswoman nicole c west for services including private investigations work to find truant teens dry cleaning drapes and tutoring elementary school students harris also voted four times to approve a total of 28 million in hisd contracts that included work for one of wests firms meanwhile both texas watchdog and the houston chronicle have recently reported that hisd trustee larry marshall traveled to costa rica last year on an allexpensespaid trip funded by the costa rican government and arranged by state representative borris miles an insurance agent who also services some of hisds flood insurance harris declined to comment to a reporter who approached her after last thursdays school board meeting she also did not return phone messages for comment or respond to a list of emailed questions from texas watchdog but in public comments she made during the thursday meeting  a couple of hours after texas watchdog supplied hisd with an extensive list of questions for this story  harris defended what she said were her many friendships with hisd vendors and others working in and for hisd that presentation we saw during the meeting is dedicated to the 12000 teachers all of the principals all of our partners all of our vendors all of the folks that provide a great service and provide great added value to the houston independent school district and im not ashamed ever to say that im friends with some of em  sometimes its hard to be my friend theyre gonna do a story every week about my friends ive got so many friends in this district so many places i sit on in this district but thats fine just know she said echoing something jesus told his disciples in the book of matthew if you dont deny me i wont deny you  about the classes  the class offerings demetra jones has arranged for hisd are varied among the classes she and her company training  leadership consulting also sometimes called training leadership  consulting or tl consulting arranged for hisd records show tl consulting is  deeply involved in learning about the educational stateoftheart investigating research and designing instructional materials reads a testimonial attributed to ortiz middle on the companys website along with this one from lewis elementary training leadership  consulting have exceptional certified instructors  making a difference in our schools  meanwhile records show another of jones firms the fdr group was paid 5040 for preparing sterling high students for the texas assessment of knowledge and skills tests last october and another 3900 to put on parenting classes last september hisds online check register shows checks for those amounts  but written on different dates  made out directly to demetra c jones last fall with jones having the same hisd vendor number as the fdr group the school district cant just make teachers work in afterschool programs without paying them more for it spencer said in many instances vendors who provide afterschool programs do so at a lower cost rate than teachers  the school district said it has no consulting agreements for the new allgirls academy that is slated to launch this fall but tl consulting has had on its website recently a downloadable pdf application for afterschool programs at the allgirls school with offerings as varied as robotics lacrosse and wacky writing  young womens college preparatory academy after school program provided by training and leadership consulting inc the application reads for questions regarding all offerings please contract demetra jones tlc inc it says and lists tl consultings phone number and email address the pdf was available on tl consultings website as recently as early yesterday afternoon  but it appeared to have been removed from the website later in the day keeping up with the joneses  frank jones has been harris campaign treasurer since at least 2008 online campaign finance records show harris also confirmed frank jones was her campaign treasurer in a recent interview with texas watchdog for a previous story demetra jones was also the contact person for a 250ahead campaign fundraiser for harris that was held one evening last week at the posh tonys restaurant on richmond avenue invitations for the event one of which was obtained by the west university examiner asked people to mail checks to demetra jones at the same 315 w alabama st address as the office building where paula harris and her husband dwayne base multiple businesses they run the harrises own the building according to property records when it first sought certification as a minority business from the houston city government in 2009 tl consulting reported that one of its largest previous jobs was 300 in training it put on for dpm investments paula and dwayne harris investment firm though the company submitted 600 worth of invoices from dpm to back up its application demetras experience includes planning developing and implementing human resource strategies preparing new hire recruitment policies structuring development training programs and developing educational health and safety seminars demetra jones online bio says mrs jones services have been acquired by local governmental offices school districts and private business entities  tl consultings address is listed in much of the hisd paperwork as a residence on macgregor way south of the texas southern university campus  the same address where both frank and demetra jones are registered to vote however one document jones filed this month with hisd lists the companys address as 315 w alabama st the harrises office building harris county records show training and leadership consulting is a registered assumed name commonly known as doing business as with demetra jones as the owner though the firm calls itself training and leadership consulting inc  on its web site and uses the inc  on hisd paperwork the texas secretary of states office had no record last week of a corporation by that name or a tl consulting tied to a demetra jones demetra jones also signed off on hisd paperwork as recently as this year indicating the firm is a sole proprietorship or individual not a partnership or corporation and city of houston records show the company is a sole proprietorship frank jones is listed as the registered agent of the fdr group a limited liability company in business records from the texas secretary of states office a current cochairman of the houston library board frank jones is a prominent attorney specializing in public finance and government issues his official biography from his law firm greenberg traurig lists among his major accomplishments as playing a major role in the creation of the reliant park complex minute maid park and the toyota center frank jones is also hisds appointee to the authority in charge of redeveloping houstons old spanish trailalameda road neighborhood he was appointed by the harris county commissioners court to the board of the gulf coast waste disposal authority approving the work  in three cases records indicate the classes put on by jones and her firms began even though there wasnt enough money in the proper budget fund to pay for them  but school principals moved money around and made it happen tl consulting was to put on ged and esl training at ortiz middle school between sept 27 2010 and may 21 this year but budget officers wrote as late as nov 19 that there were not enough funds to pay for it records show two weeks later the funds had been made available fdr group was hired to put on taks preparation classes oct 418 for the juniors and seniors at sterling high school but as late as nov 10  which would have been after the classes had ended  hisds legal office complained to the high school that there werent enough funds in the budget records show that day money was moved around to pay for it tl consulting was hired to put on 20000 worth of afterschool enrichment programs at alcott elementary between sept 7 2010 and july 8 2011 but as late as sept 13 hisds legal office said there were no funds in the budget for it records show at the same time five sets of classes appear to have begun before two of hisds top administrators the district controller and general counsel signed off on the contracts for them in two cases records show the two administrators signed off on the contracts after the classes were already supposed to be over  the taks prep classes at sterling high were slated to end oct 18 but hisd general counsel elneita hutchinstaylor didnt sign the contract for the classes with fdr group until nov 11 and hisd controller kenneth huewitt didnt sign until six days after that records show for a second set of ged and esl classes at ortiz middle slated to run sept 27dec 17 hisds top lawyer didnt approve the contract until jan 3 and the controller approved it four days after that in most of the cases jones and her firms were hired not at the request of hisds central office but at the request of individual school principals and the manager of hisds afterschool programs records show sterling high principal leviticus williams wanted jones companies hired to prepare juniors and seniors for the taks test last fall and wanted jones firms hired to put on parent enrichment classes at the school this spring records show williams did not return an email message or multiple phone messages left at his school office also not returning an email or phone message was jonnelle hollins the afterschool chief her name appears on documents as requesting to hire jones and her firms for eight afterschool and gedesl programs including those at oates alcott and blackshear elementaries and worthing and scarborough high schools evaluating the qualifications of an educational consultant is the responsibility of the schooldepartment hiring them spencer said to hire an educational consultant the school is required to submit to hisds finance department the consulting contract and a w9 tax form he said hisd which has nearly 300 schools has long had a culture of empowered principals hisd principals for instance largely set their own schools budgets based on the funds theyre allocated by the central office frank jones legal work for hisd  while the school system was hiring his wife to arrange afterschool programs hisd also hired frank jones to take the lead on cutting the deal to bring grier to houston from california two years ago f jones  the firm was to be paid a flat 20000 for its services in negotiating with grier along with any travel or outofpocket expenses incurred according to hisds agreement with the firm hisd relied on frank jones even though his firm greenberg traurig does not appear on the list of law firms that the district trustees approved for legal services in june 2009 for school year 200910 but the vote on that annual list also allows the school system to hire additional lawyers on an asneeded basis without additional approval from the trustees spencer said greenberg traurig was picked for the job by the school boards superintendent search committee spencer said hisd signed a contract with jones and greenberg traurig in august 2009 and the district inked its contract with grier the following month however greenberg traurigs name does appear on the list of law firms for school year 201112 that district trustees voted to approve last thursday night harris abstained from the vote but did not offer an explanation of why she abstained greenberg traurig is one of five law firms that had to recently pay back money to harris county for unsubstantiated travel and entertainment expenses incurred during trips to sell county bonds the houston chronicle reported an internal audit showed outgoing county financial services director edwin harrison went on outoftown trips including travel to costa rica with attorneys doing bond work for the county the firm paid back about 128000 and could lose another 175000 in billing the county is challenging our hope is that weve repaid the money back and were done with it frank jones told the chron certainly we felt we had a legitimate issue but if the county decides that it doesnt warrant payment were done theyve been a great client to the firm and we just want to put it behind us    texas watchdog editor trent seibert contributed to this story contact lynn walsh at lynntexaswatchdogorg or 7132282850 contact jennifer

                          Texas Watchdog: Houston ISD trustees president Paula Harris voted on millions of dollars in contracts ...  	2011-06-09	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://blog.chron.com/newswatch/2011/06/texas-watchdog-houston-isd-trustees-president-paula-harris-voted-on-millions-of-dollars-in-contracts-involving-close-friends-firms/	en	by lynn walsh texas watchdog  when the houston independent school district has a problem it increasingly looks to nicole west to solve it need schools painted or fences installed hisd hired nicole wests firm westco need security cameras and burglar alarms installed at schools it hired westco need drapes dry cleaned for a school auditorium it paid westco to do it need elementary school students tutored in reading hisd paid nicole west to tutor them need a high school decorated for a rededication ceremony it paid nicole west need an ambulance on standby for a high school football game it hired another of wests firms a small private ambulance service and when the nations seventhlargest school district wanted to hire a private investigations firm to track down truant highschoolers it didnt pick any of the big pi firms in houston some of whom have dozens of investigators and have been in business for decades it instead hired a small firm only a few years old owned and run by nicole west with two licensed investigators today the firms current legal address with the state is wests residence in pearland those business contacts would suggest that west is a person of many interests and talents perhaps fittingly a 2008 profile of west in a local magazine said she ascribes her success to her ability to multitask and to generate multiple streams of income  but shes also one of the closest friends of the president of hisds board of trustees paula harris harris is the godmother of wests children harris has voted four times to approve millions of dollars in school district contracts involving westco a texas watchdog investigation has found aside from those contracts west westco and three other westowned firms have done thousands of dollars in business with the houston schools  business that was not required to be put up for school board approval  since harris was elected to the school board in 2007 records show in a phone interview with texas watchdog harris said her votes on contracts involving westco were ethical and were not conflicts of interest she said she never used her influence to help west or her firms gain business from hisd but said a vote would be a conflict of interest only if the person involved were a relative i can say that i dont get involved or go over to hisds procurement department or over to the business side harris said the public can think what they want shes my friend  im very very proud of her and i think everybody should have smart friends  harris voted last month in april last august and in 2009 to approve the houston independent school district hiring westco ventures to share in contracts to paint put up fences and install security systems at houston schools records show the total value of the contracts is 28 million though westco would be in line to receive only a fraction of that work the school districts online check register showed payments of 167 million to westco as of last month harris votes on the contracts involving westco are entirely legal under state and local laws and ordinances and are allowed under hisd policies governing trustees ethical conduct but the allegations of a potential conflict for harris a firstterm trustee who is up for reelection this year come after a series of other ethical problems have rocked hisd and its leadership school board member diana davila resigned last year soon after she had tried to get her husband appointed to an hisd oversight board and the federal government recently unfroze millions of dollars in hisd technology funding it blocked after it was revealed that hisd tech officers accepted bigticket personal loans and other gifts and freebies from tech vendors as head of the trustees for the nations seventhlargest school system harris is a prominent young houston political figure she has been nominated for induction this year to the greater houston womens chamber of commerce hall of fame a petroleum engineer by training she is head of community affairs for oldfield services giant schlumberger in an emailed statement in response to texas watchdogs questions the school district stressed it works hard to be ethical but reiterated that votes such as harris break no laws or ethics rules hisd has one of the strongest ethics and conflict of interest policies of any school district in texas read the statement released by district spokesman jason spencer read the complete statement and texas watchdogs questions posed to the district here the districts conflicts of interest policies are significantly tighter than any restrictions in state law to our knowledge hisd was the first school district in texas to adopt a local policy prohibiting businesses in which trustees or trustees relatives have a financial interest from contracting with the district  aside from the contracts harris voted to approve records show that west westco and three other westowned firms have done roughly 125000 in business with the houston schools since harris was elected to the school board in 2007 that did not require the school trustees approval records show because of the relatively small amount of money involved in the individual projects those payments include 19200 to wests private investigations firm to track down truants 2300 for westco to restore and clean drapes for an elementary school auditorium and 5400 for another west firm to tutor elementary school students in reading the total amount paid to nicole wests firms by hisd is unclear the districts check register noted payments of almost 17 million to westco but the school district also turned over to texas watchdog a number of invoices  which appear to have been paid  from west and her companies that do not exactly line up with payments in the check register for reasons that are not clear the school district did not answer a recent question from texas watchdog addressing the discrepancy nicole has been subcontracting for the city the county the district and the state well before i got on the board harris said so if i needed to break off my friends because theyre smart and they have good companies then i would be in big trouble because most of my friends are smart and make lots of money and so i cant say that i would discontinue our friendship  westcos work for hisd harris was among the hisd trustees who voted unanimously in 2009 to approve a 10 million contract with nine firms  westco and seven others  to install indoor and outdoor security cameras fire alarms and intercoms at school buildings meeting minutes show the money was paid from bonds issued with voters approval two years earlier hisd said harris was also among the trustees who voted last august to renew that 10 million contract with westco and seven other firms minutes show in april harris and hisd trustees also unanimously approved westco as one of four companies to share in a 5 million contract for painting at schools a month later in may harris and the trustees approved westco to share with three other firms in a 3 million contract to put up fences at hisd schools the school district sought competitive bids on each of the four contracts and the groups of companies chosen for each contract were voted on by the trustees only after hisd administrators reviewed the bids and made recommendations about which firms could do the best job for the lowest cost the trustees did not vote up or down on each firm  they merely voted to approve the en masse recommendations from the hisd central office the district said in the case of the 5 million painting contract westco had the lowest cost percentage for the job records show and had the lowest pricing in most categories of the services and materials involved specifics regarding the bids on the two security camera contracts had not yet been released by hisd following texas watchdogs public records request for them filed last september a followup request for those bid specifics as well as a request for the specs on the fencing contracts approved in may was sent to hisd earlier this month registered with the state seven years ago as a limited liability company nicole west was listed as westcos president on the paperwork the company submitted to hisd as a potential vendor her husband anthony west was listed as vice president and another woman with the last name of west was listed as the corporate secretary records with the texas secretary of states office show anthony west as the firms current registered agent  westco reported to hisd that it has 10 employees and offices on south wayside drive just inside the interstate 610 loop in the gulfgatepine valley neighborhood a list of previous clients supplied by westco to hisd said the firm had previously worked for the plano richardson and magnolia

offices for westco and another westowned firm first alert ems ambulance service went unreturned our ethics statement talks about familyi really couldnt vote on anything if it was people i know harris said as long as i am not telling people to give her work it is ethical harris said hisd superintendent terry grier has previously spoken critically of hisds contracting processes saying without elaboration that theres no rhyme or reason except quite frankly influence where influence has no business coming from  the school districts twoparagraph statement issued monday in response to written questions from texas watchdog did not include a direct response to questions regarding griers opinion of harris close friendship with an hisd vendor there is no requirement in law for a school district trustee or to our knowledge any other elected official in texas to abstain from voting on a contract that has been recommended by staff simply because the trustee or elected official might have a personal friendship with someone who works for or owns a business the districts statement said however there are recent instances in which at least one hisd trustee larry marshall a retired hisd school principal abstained from voting on issues because of close personal relationships or legal battles with vendors or individuals ties between 2 old friends  giving remarks in january as she was installed as the new president of hisds trustees harris recognized nicole and anthony west and identified herself as a godparent of the wests children she also said she and nicole west were members of a group of friends who annually give toys to needy families with nicole west as the organizer of the effort harris added that both she and nicole west are godmothers to the children of state representative borris miles dhouston whom harris likened to a brother and that miles is also godfather to harris children aside from his service in the legislature miles is also an insurance agent who has provided insurance coverage to hisd he did not return calls to his insurance office in houston or his legislative office in austin for comment for this story three years ago harris nominated west for inclusion in a moms who mean business feature for the houston style publication dba magazine west was featured in a 2008 edition of the magazine which said many ask how she does it and without a doubt west is a multitasker that gets things done if you ask west to describe the force behind her drive shes quick to provide this reply success west believes in accomplishing all her set goals to include family marriage and business west ascribes her success to her ability to multitask generate multiple streams of income and the support and leadership of a great husband with parents and inlaws playing an important supportive role harris told texas watchdog that she and west have been friends for close to 20 years and if west were a sister or a family member it would be a conflict of interest but because west is merely an acquaintance or a friend or someone who i think does great business it is not harris said with westco harris said she did not consider abstaining from voting and does not think she should have abstained nicole west also donated 1500 in february 2010 year to harris reelection campaign financial disclosures show the two women also previously served together on the board of directors of houstons ensemble theatre group no one in hisd has raised an objection to harris about her relationship with west the hisd school board president said they probably would harris said if i went to them and said you know this is a company this is a good company but since i dont do that with anyone  they have no reason to raise a concern because im not on the business side of this  besides the top administrators who oversee hisd contracts and the procurement department she said she doesnt know hisds procurement officers she said harris went on to say that she believes a disgruntled contractor who has lost hisd contracts to westco has been complaining publicly about harris friendship with west he has been going around telling people including the media im gonna take paula harris down because thats how westco has the contract harris said she would not identify the individual or the company saying it is all hearsay and thats one thing she doesnt report on  dropout investigations  another west firm that has done work for the school district is nca investigations a private investigations firm that hisd hired to search for truant high schoolers invoices and other documents show because of the small amount of money involved  slightly more than 19000  hisd was not required to seek competitive bids for the work and the school district trustees were not required to vote to hire the firm sitespecific work done  by nicole wests firms  view hisd payments to nicole west and  companies in a larger map  nca was started by nicole west in 2001 according to state documents with west as the president and anthony west as treasurer the companys offices are listed on state records as the same pearland address where nicole and anthony west live nicole west is licensed by the state as a private investigator and state records available online this week showed at least one other licensed pi currently working for the firm when hisd hired nca in fall 2008 the firm was to commit up to 10 private investigators to locate missing students addresses and conduct onsite interviews to determine why the students were not showing up for classes according to its contract with hisd tracking down high schoolers who have gone awol and getting them back to school  and getting them diplomaworthy  is a key goal for houstons urban school system where a couple of years ago the dropout rate was about 16 percent and attendance figures are a crucial part of state and federal funding formulas that largely determine cashstrapped school districts budgets but how successful wests firm was in its search for hisds truants is unclear today invoices the firm submitted to the school district list only the schools involved and do not describe the results or identify or quantify the students being tracked down nor do the invoices offer the kind of pointbypoint accounting of investigators time that is a standard in many private investigators billing practices ncas contract with hisd said the company would provide a thorough report to the school district on its work but the school system doesnt have that report hisds public information coordinator told texas watchdog last fall despite that hisd paid nca a total of 19200 in late 2008 according to invoices marked as approved by hisd staff and internal hisd payment records to the best of our knowledge these have been the only two times we have hired private investigators to find truants spencer said in an email response to a question from texas watchdog though he added that it would be difficult for the school district to easily find among its files records for companies hired for that specific type of service the company was chosen by staffers at two of hisds regional offices at the time and neither of those regional superintendents still work for the houston school system spencer said  their jobs were done away with entirely in a recent reorganization they would have had to answer this question spencer said in an email in response to a question about how nca was chosen however the contracts with nca were approved and signed by two top hisd officials at the central office who are still on the job  the districts top lawyer elneita hutchinstaylor and the current controller kenneth huewitt the moms who mean business profile of west said nca has contracts with att hisd city of houston city of san antonio and several insurance companies  hisd did not answer followup questions about ncas work including a request to identify the regional superintendents who approved the hiring or whether the school system approached nca or the other way around other work for hisd wests business entities have also performed extensive work for hisd on other matters in which the costs of the individual projects didnt meet the threshold requiring the district trustees approval records show westco was paid 76000 for emergency repairs to ceilings and floors of schools damaged by hurricane ike in 2008 invoices and payment records show the firms first job for hisd was in december 2007 records show when the company did 1185 in cleaning school air ducts harris was elected to the hisd school board the previous month westco also did dry cleaning and restoration on auditorium drapes at mcdade elementary school in kashmere gardens in late 2008 costing 2300 district records show another of wests firms first alert ems was paid 600 to post an ambulance on standby for four hours at the football game between milby and reagan high schools at hisds barnett stadium on aug 29 2009 records show nicole west is president of first alert a firm that was set up in 2006 state records show wests moms who mean business profile said the firm had a fleet of 18 ambulances its offices are next door to westcos and the district paid west herself 5400 by check in early 2008 for tutoring third fourth and fifth graders at hohl elementary in the independence heights neighborhood in reading hisd invoice and payment records show the goal of the 24 hours of tutoring to the 40 students was to increase knowledge to ensure success on state exams  though the check was written personally to west the districts contract was with another west firm onsite technology records show the moms who mean business profile identified west as president and ceo of onsite which it said provides support to schools with her team of tutors and professional trainers  however a search of business records with the texas secretary of states office this week turned up no records connecting a firm called onsite with a nicole west hisd did not respond to any of texas watchdogs questions about how or why west or onsite was hired to tutor students previous to harris 2007 election to the school board the school system had paid or directly contracted west and her firms just once records indicate  she was paid 1200 for decorating wheatley high school in the fifth ward when it was rededicated in fall 2006 records show contact lynn walsh at 7132282850 or lynntexaswatchdog or on twitter at lwalsh

a routine hiphop affair but this one was different even though 7500 teens and young adults turned out to hear lil wayne j xavier mista madd and a host of other hiphop celebrities the only way to get into this event was to be tested for hiv hip hop 4 hiv was the brainchild of freshman state representative borris miles a flamboyant insurance agentturnedpolitician whose heavily black district 146 accounts for threefourths of harris countys hiv infections to miles supporters the concert was characteristic of the fresh thinking the legislator had brought to his innercity district after a surprise 2006 runoff victory over 27year incumbent al edwards but even as backers celebrate miles innovations others are concerned about a series of incidents involving the lawmaker that ranged from awkward to frightening the episodes culminated in december when miles crashed a party at the posh st regis hotel party host david harris said a drunken miles shocked guests with loud profane language before planting a godfatherstyle kiss of death on his cheeks handing him a pistol and declaringyou dont know what im capable of doing  after proclaiming himself a gangsta miles then allegedly kissed a female guest on the lips while her husband was away from the table prosecutors are scrutinizing the episode meanwhile the female recipient of miles unsolicited smooch filed a lawsuit seeking 1 million in damages and demanding the lawmaker be tested for hiv a hearing is set for feb 15 other moments include miles unilateral decision to censor an antideath penalty art exhibit at the state capitol and his profane chastisement of former us representative chris bell at a downtown party miles gearing up for a march primary rematch with edwards declined to comment on the harris and bell incidents he defends his art exhibit action because of the short mortality rate he said in an interview after his release ive tried to get things done not tomorrow but today  city councilman ronald green who has known miles for 18 years characterized the lawmaker as passionate about his work in the district  his credits include stints on the local board of the urban league and the united negro college fund in 2003 he received the ymcas super achievers award two years later he won the houston citizens chamber of commerces pinnacle award in part for moving his business to the third ward and redeveloping its rundown location hes very bright young and wealthy said francis cook an official with the across the track pac which typically supports minority candidates it might come off as brash depending on circumstances hes extremely confident hes a free negro and cant be bought hes a little hard to deal with hard to intimidate unless you can convince him to your way of thinking  miles who grew up in sunnyside the son of a louisianaborn welder and his social worker wife is best known as the owner of a successful insurance agency started in 1992 in a garage apartment the company now writes more than 45 million in premiums annually miles notes on his web site through his youth miles seemed destined to become a police officer he graduated from houstons high school for law enforcement and criminal justice then earned a degree in criminal justice at sam houston state university miles worked only two years with the hisd police force before launching his insurance agency though inspired by the activism of us representative mickey leland and others miles might well have been content to build his business but for an encounter with al edwards in austin when miles attempted to talk with edwards about health insurance for the states poor children miles said the veteran legislator brushed him off i supported al miles said but somewhere down the way my representative fell away  i saw a need a void at the state level for district 146  the district which includes a portion of meyerland and much of third ward is a study in haves and have nots nearly onethird of residents have college degrees the 2000 us census revealed but nearly 40 percent are high school dropouts in this setting edwards now 70 was an institution with civil rights credentials going back to marches with dr martin luther king jr edwards has strong ties to older black business and religious communities among his signature achievements was the designation of june 19  the day blacks learned of their emancipation  as a state holiday but to some edwards had lost touch with the needs of his constituents his 2005 bill to curb sexually suggestive performances by school cheerleaders the socalled booty bill brought ridicule from diverse quarters representative edwards had settled into a kind of normalcy said former texas southern university political scientist sanders anderson a lot of people saw borris miles as a new face he talked about revitalizing bringing in new businesses  even so in a threeway race that also included houston lawyer al bennett edwards easily claimed 48 percent of the vote  121 votes shy of victory without a runoff at that point most had given borris up for dead said former congressman bell thats when he really kicked into gear and proved a lot of people wrong  miles won the runoff with 54 percent of the vote but that victory may have set him up for future trouble i think that when youre perhaps a tad brash going in and youre able to win an upset victory when a lot of people told you it was impossible that doesnt do much to diminish your brashness bell said edwards who will face miles again in next months primary countered that his experience and legislative connections trump the freshmans firstyear triumphs which he minimized i dont know what he has done that wasnt already being done edwards said miles whole career has been characterized by energy state representative garnet coleman said he has a certain energy that bursts out at times coleman said you can deal with it through anger management through lessening the amount of alcohol you take  the politicians flareups sometimes occur in very public venues in fall 2006 miles unleashed a flood of profanity on bell after the former congressman declined to introduce another candidate at a mileshosted party miles countered that he and bell are close friends who often jocularly insult each other in march 2007 miles unilaterally removed two paintings he deemed offensive from an antideath penalty art exhibit in the capitol miles said he saw the paintings  one of a lynching the other of a man in an electric chair  while walking with his schoolage son and daughter in july 2007 miles shot in the leg a man stealing copper tubing from a house the lawmaker was building in the 3700 block of south macgregor miles told police he fired after the man pulled a knife on him in december 2007 miles appeared at the st regis party hosted by harris he came into the party uninvited with alcohol in his hands said harris he was using expletives and causing a ruckus just being overzealous you could tell he was drunk no question about it he seemed to have some real issues he kissed me on both cheeks and tried to grab my groin  miles then kissed krysynthia rido who in her lawsuit charged he engaged in a depraved unconscionable and reckless manner leaving in his wake shame embarrassment and mental trauma  coleman said he has encouraged miles whom he considers a close friend to seek counseling i dont think members of the legislature have the expectation of borris being perfect borris has represented his district and hes done it well  chronicle reporters matt stiles and matthew

                          Parker fears release of Holley video will hurt case         	2011-02-03	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://www.chron.com//news/houston-texas/article/Parker-fears-release-of-Holley-video-will-hurt-1684736.php	en	houstons mayor said thursday that the release of a video showing several houston police officers last march allegedly kicking punching and stomping on a handcuffed teenager could jeopardize the prosecution of four officers in the case we dont want to do anything to jeopardize the prosecution of these police officers mayor annise parker said thursday following a weather news conference at houston transtar the local emergency management center she said the videos release may cause the trials to be moved out of harris county parker said she was shocked and disgusted when she first viewed the tape last year my feelings havent changed this is not acceptable in houston she said the video was recorded by at least two surveillance cameras march 24 at uncle bobs selfstorage at cook near beechnut the footage shows then 15yearold chad holley being chased by several officers in patrol cars after hurdling the hood of a patrol car as it hits a chain link fence holley lay down on his stomach with his hands up officers can be seen descending on him the video was released wednesday to ktrktv channel 13 by community activist quanell x while he was at the television station a state district judge issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting the release last year a federal judge granted a request from harris county district attorney pat lykos to block the release of the footage saying pretrial publication would likely prevent the four hpd officers from receiving a fair trial on misdemeanor charges of oppression legal experts said any punishment is unlikely against quanell x because he was not a party to that ruling said houston attorney joe larsen larsen represents the houston chronicle and four local television stations in opposing lykos request for a federal protective order barring the release at an naacp press conference thursday quanell x said he had planned to release the video to all media outlets in houston the activist obtained the footage as part of the discovery process in a slander lawsuit lodged against him by an officer involved in the case houston police chief charles mcclelland suspended eight officers within three days of receiving the tape last year three other officers were fired without being charged five additional officers received twoday suspensions in june andrew blomberg phil bryan raad hassan and drew ryser were indicted on misdemeanor official suppression charges and fired bryan and hassan also were charged with violation of the civil rights of a prisoner also a misdemeanor other community leaders including state representative borris miles dhouston and naacp houston president dz cofield said at thursdays news conference that they were shocked by the actions depicted on the tape this is about rogue cops abusing our children miles said the videotapes release also brought condemnation from houstons courthouse lykos issued a statement echoing the mayors concerns despite the tapes release we will continue to do everything possible to ensure that both the state and the defense are given a fair trial she said independence heights community activist john branch said he suspects the tape was withheld to prevent the grand jury from returning harsher charges if that was me beating the hell out of somebody and they caught me on video doing it they would probably get me with attempted murder branch said felony charges for assault were not available to grand jurors because holley did not receive serious bodily injury under the law other community leaders including natasha johnson president of the independence heights super neighborhood council said the video was disturbing she credited mcclelland with suspending the officers but said she believes other incidents are not being reported she also said misdemeanor charges did not seem severe enough after viewing the tape an attorney for one of the officers dick deguerin said the video should not have been released and maintained that his client blomberg is innocent deguerin acknowledged that it looks like his client is stomping the 15yearolds head but that a closer inspection shows him using his foot to get the teen who is lying flat on his stomach to put his left hand down so he can be handcuffed he expects two experts on police force to testify that blomberg used reasonable police procedure deguerin said he may request a change of venue theres clearly some ugly stuff that happens deguerin said we volunteered to go first so we could try our case cleanly  he said weighing his clients right to a fair trial versus the freedom of speech is difficult it seems to me that the right of the public to know can be postponed a little bit deguerin said its not going to be totally denied its just that we need to get a fair trial  chronicle reporter cindy george contributed to this report

                          Primary Day is today         	2014-03-04	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://blog.chron.com/kuffsworld/2014/03/primary-day-is-today/	en	today is the day when we begin to get a temporary respite from the mailers robocalls and tvradio ads as the people who didnt vote early make their way to the ballot box for the primaries in harris county a list of democratic polling places is here and a list of republican polling places is here note that some precincts are combined into one location and that at some locations only one party primary is voting check where you need to go before you head out if youre not sure what precinct youre in its on your voter registration card or you can look yourself up here and yes remember to bring your acceptable form of photo id a lot of the higher profile races are really just finishing up round one today on the republican side all of the statewides except governor land commissioner and most likely us senate are expected to go to a runoff thats what i meant by a temporary respite from the campaigns theyll crank right back up after a day or two and keep at it until may democrats have two multicandidate statewide races for us senate and ag commissioner if the former gets any attention itll be because kesha rogers is one of the candidates wont that be fun if it happens here in harris county republicans will likely have to finish sorting out races in cd36 hd129 hd132 the 311th family district court county criminal court at law 10 justice of the peace precinct 4 place 2 and possibly party chair all but the 311th and party chair are open seats which tend to draw multiple candidates dems had no such vacancies this cycle so the only runoff voting well face will be in the statewide races ive discussed the matter of turnout in prior entries about early voting but this ap story suggests the efforts of battleground texas will be judged by how many dems wind up voting this march senator wendy davis the march 4 democratic primary will reveal how much the group has accomplished on the road to the general election in november democrats hope to make texas a battleground state by 2016 to at the very least force the gop to divert resources to preserving their hold on the second largest number of electoral college seats in the country if democrats could routinely win in texas along with their strongholds in california and new york they could hold the white house for years to come but no democrat has won a statewide election since 1994 and participation in the primary as a percentage of the states population has steadily dropped to 590000 in 2012 the one exception was the 2008 primary in which obama faced off against hillary clinton a race that brought out a record 28 million voters it gives you a sense of what is possible if you have very competitive mobilization efforts going on said james henson a political scientist at the university of texas at austin an expert on voter behavior in texas theres a chicken and egg question do you get people mobilized and then you get more competitive races or do you get more competitive races and then that helps mobilize people   expectations for todays primary have been tamped down by the fact that davis doesnt face a serious democratic challenger greg abbott the state attorney general is the presumptive republican nominee for governor bgt executive director jenn brown said the group is far more focused on turning out the vote in november when battleground texas will fully activate the neighborhood networks to staff phone banks knock on doors and help democratic voters get to the polls weather may be a factor in turnout today which is another reason why i make a habit of voting early check with your county election administrator before you head out  polling hours may vary and polling locations may be combined due to weather issues brian sweany also talked turnout  despite the money and the open seats and the general buzz in the media new voters arent paying much attention in the 2012 republican primary nearly 145 million ballots were cast for president in the 2010 republican primary just fewer than 15 million ballots were cast for governor greg abbott will be the singlebiggest vote getter from any candidate from either party but he wants to see his number as high as possible to emphasize the story line of inevitability i remain convinced that at least part of the ted nugent strategy on the first day of early voting was connected to this wendy davis on the other hand wants to be able to beat the numbers for the 2012 democratic primary 590000 votes or 2010 democratic primary 680000 votes which will help her advance the story line of a resurgence in her party if her vote totals slip it shows that nothing has changed in her party it would be kind of funny if baby bush winds up getting more votes than abbott wouldnt it he has only one opponent which makes that outcome at least a possibility i dont doubt that davis would like to see more votes cast than in either of the last two primaries but i dont think it matters that much as ive noted before where turnout is up for dems from 2010 in early voting is in the counties with the hottest local races  bexar dallas travis and tarrant thanks to cd33 and sd10 turnout is down in harris county as there are basically three moreorless high profile primaries  for da where kim ogg is trying to keep lloyd oliver from soiling the ticket again sd15 where senator john whitmire faces his first real challenger in forever and the 113th civil district court also known as steven kirkland versus george fleming round ii  but its not down that much when you consider that in 2010 there was bill white for governor drumming up votes in his back yard a decent threeway race for lite guv a high profile challenge to representative sheila jackson lee in cd18 round 3 of borris miles versus al edwards and thirty  contested judicial primaries dem turnout in harris aint too shabby go compare to the 2006 primary which like this year had contested races for governor us senate and ag commissioner plus lite guv and round 1 of miles v edwards and youll see what low turnout really looks like anyway there will be plenty to talk about beginning tomorrow once all the results are in for a look at some gop races to watch check out burka and the observer feel free to leave your predictions about turnout winners and whatever else in the comments
                          Miles, Edwards rekindle rivalry for House seat         	2010-02-23	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://www.chron.com//news/houston-texas/article/Miles-Edwards-rekindle-rivalry-for-House-seat-1708155.php	en	in the 4000 block of old spanish trail an old theater juts like a ships prow above the aging strip centers empty lots and fastfood joints along the busy thoroughfare that slices across south houston these days the majestic ost is an abandoned hulk its denizens are drug addicts prostitutes and the homeless borris miles candidate for the state legislature from district 146 contends the theater symbolizes the neglect and inattention the district gets from the incumbent longtime house member al edwards the majestic is owned by juneteenth usa a nonprofit organization that acquired it in 1993 edwards who sponsored legislation in 1979 making juneteenth a state holiday helped found the organization and serves on its board edwards has represented district 146 since 1979  except for 200608 when miles won the heavily black district it has some of harris countys poorest neighborhoods including much of third ward the 71yearold edwards a lay minister and real estate broker is third in seniority in the legislature theres no comparison in terms of abilities and skills and experience he said of miles seniority is only as good as the person whose hands its in miles scoffed if my representative is so powerful on the house floor we should be a land of milk and honey were not  miles has a penchant for attracting attention both good and bad on a radio talk show earlier this month he brought in a drugtesting firm and gave a urine sample on the air it came back negative as a legislator he took it upon himself to remove two pieces of controversial art on display at the capitol in 2007 he shot and wounded a man stealing copper tubing from a house miles was building on south macgregor no charges were filed the most notorious incident involved charges that he crashed the 2007 holiday party of a rival insurance executive where he proclaimed himself a gangsta brandished a gun and kissed a woman while her husband was away from the table the whole episode was in miles words a smear tactic perpetuated by edwards supporters and the media a jury took only 45 minutes to acquit him of two counts of deadly conduct despite the acquittal he lost his reelection bid in the 2008 democratic primary a native houstonian and the sixth of 16 children edwards is a graduate of the old phyllis wheatley high school and texas southern university with an associates degree from the college of biblical studies in houston hes never pastored a church but occasionally preaches at his home congregation hes best known for two pieces of legislation  the juneteenth bill and his 2005 booty bill to curb suggestive gyrations by school cheerleaders and dance teams having participated in civil rights sitins and marches edwards remains a familiar figure in the district and still has strong ties to older black businesses and churches in my opinion hes very informative said helen martin a cashier at the wyatts cafeteria on ost where edwards holds breakfast gatherings for constituents anybody who shows up and wants to know about the session he always has a lot to tell them he has a lot of support in the community  miles who often points out that his opponent regularly shows up on texas monthly magazines worst legislators list insists edwards does not represent the interests of the district he also said that many of the districts voters dont know the veteran lawmaker was an ally of former republican house speaker tom craddick a hardline conservative ive learned to work with blacks and whites males and females republicans and democrats edwards said it doesnt make you a republican if you sit down with them and work things out to get things done  if reelected to a 16th term edwards said his priorities will be insurance reform raising the exemption on property taxes housing development and putting more police officers on the street edwards is conducting a lowkey campaign relying on the power of name recognition miles on the other hand said he never stopped running since launching his first race against edwards in 2005 borris won the first time because he ran a very thorough effective campaign said political consultant kathryn mcniel he lined up leadership he had money and he had a strong message of change  born and raised in sunnyside married and the father of three the 44yearold businessman earned a criminal justice degree from sam houston state university and worked as a houston independent school district police

Who'll Control the Crayons Next Year?	2010-01-11	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2010/01/11/wholl-control-the-crayons-next-year/	en	as more candidate filings become available from the states bigger counties its apparent that republicans are going to have a noisy beginning to the year theyve got an unusual number of primary election challengers to their legislative incumbents democrats meanwhile are making a weak play for political control in the next decade thats not an assessment of whether their candidates can compete  its about whether theyre in position to make real gains even if they do win some elections redistricting comes around in 2011 and the minority party needs either a house majority or a majority of seats on an arcane legislative board to control the mapmaking they dont appear to be in position to do that in a year of active conservative protests against federal spending and economic and health policies texas legislators on the state and federal level face more competition than usual on this years ballots itll be about two weeks before candidates report their campaign finances  thatll be the first real clue as to the strength of the challengers and the incumbents they seek to depose texas democrats meanwhile are mounting a mild offensive on statewide offices that figure into redistricting the legislature will try to draw new political maps after the 2010 census if they fail or the governor vetoes their plans congressional maps will go to court and state maps will go to a fivemember panel that includes the lieutenant governor the speaker of the house the comptroller land commissioner and attorney general democrats didnt produce a comptroller candidate and recent resignations and party switches made it more difficult to take control of the house and the speakership next year theyd have to go threeofthree  winning lite guv attorney general and land commissioner to have a majority on the legislative redistricting board a different perspective a democrat of some repute take it either way points out that while there are weaknesses on the ticket nobody challenged the comptroller with her seat on the lrb  the democrats are a lot better off than they were in october and early november theres a solid andor wellfinanced candidates for governor now in farouk shami and bill white and the other candidates who were clamoring for that job have scattered either leaving tom schieffer or moving on to another race kinky friedman and hank gilbert for some democrats compared with the prospects before halloween or thanksgiving this ticket looks actually desirable the first monday of the year was the filing deadline for the 2010 elections and the parties published preliminary lists  that means they are maddeningly incomplete  of the people who want to run the state next year democrats and republicans will nominate their candidates in the march primaries libertarians had the same filing deadline but will choose their nominees in a series of county district and state conventions in march and june the lists come with caveats candidates whose districts dont cross county lines file with local party officials and not with the state the state parties are working to get accurate master lists only the libertarian list is full and complete at the moment they have ten days to gather names from the counties and to scrub and deliver the final rosters to the texas secretary of state which administers elections the full ballots as they stand now can be found in the election 2010 database at our sibling publication the texas tribune some notes from the filings  the biggest surprise of the deadline filers was former state senator hector uribe dbrownsville who broke a 14year absence from the ballot by filing for land commissioner hell face bill burton of athens in the democratic primary the winner will face incumbent republican jerry patterson in november cinema trivia fans uribe and patterson were both in the alamo  uribe as an actor and patterson as an extra and uribe had a speaking part in no country for old men and kinky friedman and hank gilbert will spar for the right to face republican agriculture commissioner todd staples in november  most of whats at the top of the ballot was known but some new folks joined the battle five libertarians want that job led by jeff daiell whos been on the ballot for houston city council us senate and for governor twice seven democrats filed including alma aguado felix alvarado bill dear clement glenn star locke farouk shami and bill white if nothing else that number raises the chances of a primary runoff on april 13  the high number of candidates could make it difficult for anyone to get more than 50 percent the republicans have three candidates and youve heard of all of them kay bailey hutchison debra medina and rick perry  linda chavezthompson joined the lieutenant governor field the san antonio labor leader will run against former travis county district attorney ronnie earle and restaurateur marc katz the winner will face incumbent republican david dewhurst in november  us representative sheila jackson lee dhouston drew a primary challenge from houston city councilman jarvis johnson the democrats didnt put up candidates for all of the statewide court seats on the ballot but the libertarians did six republicans and a democrat are after an open seat on the texas supreme court  a group that includes former state representative rick green of dripping springs  and two republicans and a democrat are in the running for the seat held since october by justice eva guzman of houston  house speaker joe straus elected just a year ago after a contentious couple of weeks didnt draw a majorparty opponent  denton county republicans myra crownover and burt solomons unexpectedly drew primary opponents shell face kurt hyde on march 2 hell face mike murphy  democrats are challenging republicans in all three texas supreme court slots on

democrat us representative kevin brady rconroe drew three primary opponents and so did us representative ron paul rsurfside and republican kay granger of fort worth drew two  as expected representative chuck hopson of jacksonville will have opposition in his first gop primary this year hopson switched parties in november and some of his new friends had hoped to keep the field clear but two republicans in that east texas district are gunning for him in what should be one of the most interesting races on the ballot  the house ballot has three rematches on it in houston al edwards will be defending his seat against fellow democrat borris miles who won it away in 2006 and then lost the first rematch in 2008 nearby representative kristi thibaut dhouston will face the guy she beat last year former representative jim murphy rhouston in waco republican charles doc anderson will face democrat john mabry in november he beat mabry to win the seat in 2004  representative jim dunnam of waco the leader of the house democrats has an opponent leon county gop chair marva beck signed up on the last day to oppose him  and there were no lastminute resignations the only members who volunteered not to come back  one in the senate and eight in the house  announced their intentions well before the filing deadline if you dont have a calculator handy that means 100 percent of the congressional delegation 96 percent of the state senators and 95 percent of the state representatives want to come back the drops senator eliot shapleigh del paso and representatives frank corte rsan

opponents arent the same thing as competitors no libertarian has posed an electoral threat to a republican or democratic candidate in state office in past elections unless theres an upset of the most unusual kind in the offing theyre not likely to pull it off this time and some candidates from the major parties drew only libertarian opponents that list includes comptroller susan combs the only

dconroe has three primary opponents but no democrats entered that race kenny marchant rcoppell has one challenger in the gop primary as does john carter rgeorgetown three of the races for the state board of education will be family fights that end after the primaries unless the libertarians in those races can find unprecedented support don mcleroy geraldine tincy miller and bob craig all have

conversely candidates in some races dont have to break a competitive sweat until later in the year lieutenant governor david dewhurst for instance doesnt have a primary fight but will face a democrat in november the race for attorney general is also a november contest with one republican one democrat and one libertarian in the hunt add in two statewide judicial races four congressional contests one sboe matchup two senate races and 29 house fights last we come to the brawlers  the races where theres a primary or two and then a general the candidates will have to fight in march and fight again in november that describes the race at the top of the bill which has seven democrats three republicans and five libertarians each thinks she or he should be the next governor of texas the democratic halves of the races for lite guv land and agriculture commissioners all feature primaries the winners of which will battle republican incumbents in november but rick perry is the only statewide officeholder whos being challenged both in march and november us representative ralph hall rrockwall will see challenges across the calendar as will michael mccaul raustin mike conaway rmidland kay granger rfort worth ron paul rsurfside ruben hinojosa dmercedes sheila jackson lee dhouston and ciro rodriguez dsan antonio former representative ken mercer a san antonio republican whos now on the sboe will face both spring and fall opponents carlos uresti dsan antonio is the only state senator with both a primary fight and a general election fight in front of him as for the texas house patrick rose ddripping springs has opposition in march and november plenty of members face a democrat or a republican next year but hes the only one wholl face both what seemed like a mountain on wednesday might in fact be a molehill this week governor rick perry announced his intention to promote constitutional amendments to limit spending in texas causing cheers from supporters and jeers from critics but upon further review the amendments might not be worth the uproar perry outlined two amendments one would limit spending increases to the rate of inflation and population growth while the other would require a twothirds majority to raise taxes first of all the proposals werent exactly new perry campaign spokesperson catherine frazier described the governors announcement as reiterating his priority which was outlined a year ago in perrys state of the state speech then theres the fact that lawmakers already spend within the proposed limits according to both the center for public policy priorities and the texas taxpayers research association the spending limitation has mattered far less than the conservatism of the legislature said dale craymer of ttra such amendments dont eliminate all mischief explains craymer because there are a lot of things that states can do administratively that harm taxpayers but dont raise taxes  craymer whose group represents businesses that pay corporate sales property and other taxes in the state points to the 2003 session when during tight economic times the legislature avoided raising taxes but also denied taxpayers their tax refunds eventually the comptroller allowed individuals to claim the refunds as tax credits taxpayers ended up suffering craymer says despite the fact that taxes technically stayed the same unsurprisingly perrys chief rival had a negative take on his plan us senator kay bailey hutchisons camp called the announcement an election year ploy  campaign spokesman joe pounder argued that the governor already had the power to control spending and tax increases with his veto pen i dont understand why rick perry needs twothirds of the legislature to prevent a tax increase if he could just veto a tax increase pounder said scott mccown at cppp says that while the proposed limits would not have affected much in the last few years theyre not a good idea hes concerned over future limitations such amendments would cause just because texas is consistently one of the lowest spending states doesnt mean it should be he says mccown hopes to see increased funding for education and other social programs  and the amendments might prevent such growth going forward we need to spend more than population growth and inflation and this would not allow us to do that he said preventing that sort of expansion is exactly why some people say the proposals are important i think rather objectively you can say that what weve done works says michael sullivan of empower texans which advocates for limited government but a big chunk of it has been because we have had some pretty good rightthinking people in place   by abby rapoport the young conservatives of texas on wednesday released its scorecard of the 81st legislative session complete with an updated list of the gops republicans in name only rinos and the sessions most liberal legislators legislators were graded on how often they voted in line with the groups own principals which include the belief that the declaration of independence recognizes the freedom of an individual as inherited from one sovereign god and predictably that the states of this nation are and of right ought to be free and independent  because their lifetime voting records fall in line with the ycts agenda less than 50 percent of the time republican sens kip averitt of waco and kevin eltife of tyler made the groups rino list as did representatives charlie geren of fort worth tommy merritt of longview and delwin jones of lubbock who sided with the yct less than 60 percent everyone on that list save eltife drew at least one primary opponent in 2010 the report includes a new analysis that compares how committee chairs voted during the last two sessions a barometer of sorts to measure committee action during the tenure of republican house speaker joe straus rsan antonio and contrast it to the performance under his predecessor representative tom craddick rmidland one of the most telling ways to measure a speaker is to evaluate who he appointed as committee chairs because these people truly dominate the legislative process said tony mcdonald the tycs vicechairman of legislative affairs if the tyc ruled over state politics straus would be sent out to pasture as committee chairs slid an average of 25 points according to the groups scorecard representative rafael anchia of dallas was bestowed the honor of most liberal legislator for never voting in line with the group and shares space on the list with more than two dozen lawmakers all democrats who pleased the yct 10 percent of the time or less the yct relied mainly on record votes on bills considered for second reading in the house and on the motion to suspend the regular order of business in the senate the two votes are the most important in determining whether a piece of legislation moves forward and therefore are the best point in the legislative process to measure our representatives positions explained mcdonald  by julian aguilar former representative timoteo garza deagle pass got unconvicted on procedural grounds by the 5th us circuit court of appeals he and his mom and dad were convicted on charges they misappropriated money from the lucky eagle casino run by the kickapoo tribe for personal and political use isidro garza jr is a former

opponent im shorter than david dewhurst thats an attribute nobody else can say they have  texas ranks fortysixth among all states in health care and first in its percentage of uninsured citizens one in five texans has no health insurance the top four diagnosed causes of death among texans are heart disease cancer stroke and respiratory diseases such as emphysema in addition to killing us smoking and obesity cause preventable diseases that are very expensive to treat and a significant loss of workforce productivity including increased absenteeism and disability meanwhile two trends will soon strain our medical care system the first is that texas is aging if roughly one in ten texans today is over age 65 in 2050 one in six will be over 65 the second is that the rates of childhood and adult obesity here continue to rise with the shifting racial and ethnic profile of the state they rise faster here than in many other parts of the country the demand for care and the cost of care for seniors will compete with the demand and cost of care for the increasing number of texans who are obese and as a result have also been or will be diagnosed with heart disease cancer diabetes or some forms of arthritis all of these conditions are treatable but theyre expensive to treat and occupy the attention of a physician workforce that is in short supply while the national health reform debate of late has centered on universal insurance coverage and cost control lets be clear whether were talking national health reform or texasspecific health reform the prize is optimal health for all which among other positive benefits will surely reduce the demand for medical care of preventable diseases the texas health agenda for 2010 then should help texans stay or become as optimally healthy as possible and provide access to preventive chronic and acute care   when appropriate and necessary three strategies can move texas in the right direction a statewide indoor smoking ban statewide universal k12 coordinated school health programs and the serious consideration of all available options to reduce the number of uninsured texans ill start with the last one first there is no doubt that insuring more texans will be an expensive proposition however for a state that takes pride in its christian values and sensibilities as it well should universal insurance is a moral imperative in the spirit of the good samaritan furthermore the cost associated with increasing the number of insured texans could be lessened by banning indoor smoking in all public places and assuring that all schools have coordinated health programs that improve the quality of food in the schools make physical education a daily expectation and incorporate healthy lifestyle lessons into the daily curriculum smoking tobacco increases the likelihood of premature disease disability and death from heart disease lung cancer and emphysema indoor smoking bans are associated with a fairly immediate reduction of admissions to hospitals for myocardial infarctions or heart attacks fewer myocardial infarctions are good for families theres less grief and anguish good for employers less sick leave disability and medical care costs and good for medical care systems less of a cost to the public system and less demand for care in sometimes overcrowded emergency room settings smoking bans make it easier for those who want to quit smoking to do so and more difficult for those who want to start to do so  particularly adolescents a statewide indoor smoking ban is a relatively inexpensive way to reduce medical care utilization and cost and improve the health of texans coordinated school health programs hold the promise of reversing and preventing childhood obesity not only do they improve childrens health but theyre associated with improved academic performance and decreased disciplinary problems high school graduation and some college education is associated with better adult health status childhood obesity is on the rise it threatens the health of children when theyre children and when they become adults the cost of universal coordinated school health programs is on the order of 10 to 15 per child per year in contrast to a cost of approximately 1000 per year for medical care better health and better academic performance make this a mustdo the ultimate goal is the best health possible for each texan and for all texans a healthy workforce and healthy texas children mean a state that competes effectively for business the 2010 health agenda for texas therefore should be about the publics health the health of 24 million texans a physically healthy texas is a fiscally healthy texas  eduardo sanchez md mph was commissioner of the texas department of state health services from 2004 to 2006 and the texas department of health from 2001 to 2004 he is currently a vice president and chief medical offer for blue cross and blue shield of texas unemployment trends are reversing and thankfully more of our states employers are opening their doors to new employees however in order to restore jobs lost during the recession and to prepare for those ready to enter the job market texas must create more than two million jobs in the next decade according to the us chamber of commerce that wont be easy but the good news is that we are starting to make progress a key factor in texas achieving this job growth target is having educated employees available to fill positions as they become available a recent article in the economist noted that while texas enjoys the best business climate in america future problems related to education could erode that status dramatically the texas association of business believes texas must establish a longterm goal of raising the education attainment of its workforce to a globally competitive level of 55 percent of the working age population age 2564 holding an associate degree or above by the year 2030 the business community pays for twothirds of the cost of educating our children and will be the ultimate consumers of their knowledge when companies seek to fill jobs as such the texas business community must step up to the plate as a critical friend of education by demanding firstclass education and firstclass results beyond the obvious economic imperative a moral imperative exists that challenges the texas education system to produce stronger results in order to meet the target of restoring and creating more goodpaying jobs the business community must engage at both the state and local level to that end we should all support three changes to our education system implement an honest accountability system the current academic accountability system is reminiscent of enron in many ways for example the system rewards schools for the academic performance that they expect to happen but that has not yet actually occurred this backwards process has caused a falsepositive spike in the number of schools rated exemplary or recognized now at 61 this same system also gives schools ratings such as academically acceptable where 49 of the students can fail sections of the texas assessment of knowledge and skills as if those statistics are not outrageous enough the texas education agency which implements the education standards set by the legislature has the audacity to claim that the texas dropout rate is only 12 everybody knows the number to be much greater the current education system will not allow texas to remain globally competitive if texans were unflinchingly honest about how our students are truly performing we would be able to fully address the scope of the issue the ball is in the court of the texas education agency to account for the real numbers foster a collegegoing culture our students must be engrained with the expectation that they will attain postsecondary education while at the same time providing them with the information and tools necessary to do so the texas higher education coordinating board is already taking important steps in educating texans about the financial options available for students and their families who worry about how they will pay for academic options create a resultsbased higher education finance system texas must alter the funding formulas it uses for higher education and base them on the successful completion of courses not simply classroom attendance adult basic education and remedial education must be funded along similar lines in order to ensure that the money is being used in the production of results not just to support education bureaucracy the biggest threat to our business climate is a future workforce that is illprepared to meet the demands of an increasingly sophisticated job market if our students fall short of employer expectations industries will simply leave texas and go to a state that has a steady supply of educated young adults prepared to fill their expectations stakeholders must fight to heighten our education standards otherwise texas and its students will be left behind addressing our education system must be priority number one in 2010  bill hammond is president and ceo of the texas association

Cannibals	2008-01-14	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2008/01/14/cannibals/	en	political cannibalism is a bipartisan activity representative lon burnam is the first this year to cross over openly and endorse challengers to some of his fellow house democrats burnam endorsed sandra rodriguez brian thompson and armando walle those are the challengers respectively to kino flores dpalmview dawnna dukes daustin and kevin bailey dhouston burnam who was the first house democrat to openly spurn speaker tom craddick voting against craddicks first election in 2003 cited their support for the republican speaker as the reason hes opposing the other reps hes never openly endorsed against an incumbent democrat he said but after five years in outer siberia it was time to change the way we do things  hes not the first one to endorse challengers  five republican members went against representative charlie geren rfort worth in a previous election and house democrats have been purging their ranks of craddick supporters for a couple of cycles but hes the first to do it this year if all thats not in your face enough burnam says hell announce a new political action committee next week that could help fund his efforts the name too close to craddick  on a semirelated note geren is holding an election event thats expected to attract several of his colleagues from the house including just about everyone weve heard mentioned as a potential speaker candidate other than craddick and if you catch yourself trying to think of past episodes of cannibalism heres a start the five who supported gerens opponent in the 2006 gop primary were linda harperbrown of irving bill keffer of dallas jodie laubenberg of parker bill zedler of arlington and mary denny of denton denny retired keffer got beat though hes in a rematch against his former challenger this year and harperbrown and zedler have serious opposition this year on the other side the democrats have made a specialty of this over the last few cycles former representative ron wilson dhouston lost to alma allen a candidate recruited by senator rodney ellis and supported by representative garnet coleman among others houston democrats helped oust al edwards whos back this year for another crack at borris miles and this year several of the socalled craddick ds  democrats who support the republican speaker  are running against democrats recruited by their colleagues in the lower chamber and some of the abc republicans like geren it stands for anybody but craddick have drawn opponents recruited by craddicks allies inside and outside the house ballots are just about set  the parties have to tell the secretary of state by next week what their lineups for state offices will be youre likely to keep finding errors in everybodys lists  including ours  until that final set is complete the parties decide whos eligible and whos not but candidates in some circumstances can still be challenged in court were catching some hints of challenges in the works in races where city officials and school board members are challenging incumbents it might amount to nothing but its one of the weapons open to the combatants the lists in their current form can be downloaded from our files section well put up the finals when the parties provide them this is arcane unless youre an exec with a big company that has a lot of inventory and operates and pays taxes in texas a taxable entity that elects to capitalize costs on its first report due on or after january 1 2008 may not include any costs incurred prior to the accounting period upon which the report is based  its the kind of thing that puts humans to sleep and keeps tax people awake all night and businesses are waiting to see whether comptroller susan combs will change it before she sends notices to taxpayers later this month the rule jolts some highinventory businesses  homebuilders car dealers retailers and some manufacturers some would be forced to change the way they account for cost of goods sold which is a key component in figuring the states new margins tax others  homebuilders already facing an economic slump are at the top of this list  would have to pay a higher tax the first year with the rule than without it taxpayers and lobbyists and some legislators have been talking thats a mild term in some cases to combs and her staff for weeks about the rule theyre hoping for a letter ruling that retracts it we should know soon the comptroller is publishing instructions for the new tax this month and those will probably reflect whether theyre sticking with the zero inventory rule or letting businesses compute it like they compute their other taxes rene barrientos the san antonio lawyer who filed last week to run in the democratic primary against senator judith zaffirini dlaredo doesnt have the stomach for it he dropped out saying he didnt want to run the negative campaign he thought would be required zaffirini will still face former webb county judge louis bruni jr whos running as a republican in november barrientos apparently didnt want to run the negative campaign his consultants presented as the best way to defeat zaffirini a 20year incumbent hes a good guy and a good democrat and he wasnt willing to run a campaign based almost entirely on negative attacks said colin strother who was going to be the campaign manager for the challenger the two had already traded some shots  if half of what has been hinted is true this was gonna be a nasty fight on both sides  and barrientos has been in the hunt for months but he pulled up in the week before the parties give their official ballots to the texas secretary of state i originally filed for public office because i strongly believe that our political system has been unduly influenced by special interests that college costs have made higher education too expensive for middle class families that teachers lack the funding and resources they need to educate our youth and that we need universal health care he said in a written statement  i do not wish to be involved in a campaign where important social and political issues take a back seat to heated negative attacks i just will not do it there needs to be civility in politics and such a campaign would not be healthy or productive for this district or the democratic party  zaffirini whos been running television spots since the week before christmas says shes not sure why her opponent decided not to run but shes happy about it i thank rene barrientos for withdrawing and for his statement about his distaste for negative advertising she says i agree that voters of senate district 21 want to focus on issues not on dueling messages  the primary that disappeared promised to be a spirited one zaffirini started off with a fundraiser at the south texas ranch owned by boston red sox pitcher josh beckett to get there you have to drive by a ranch owned by barrientos his guys thought it would be funny to put a bruni sign on the gate sure enough the zaffirini crew stopped and took pictures and then they used them in her announcement making fun of barrientos confusion over whom to support theres still plenty of vinegar left for the general election though she still has bruni ahead and hes also running commercials they began nearly a year ago most of them negative you can find his spots here and her tv commercial here bruni accuses zaffirini of pushing barrientos out of the race and says hes not afraid of her shes met her match and god bless her shes the most vindictive person in the world in my opinion besides osama bin laden  bruni a former laredo city councilman and webb county judge has run in the past as a democrat this time hes running as a nonpartisan republican  an austin group wants the irs to investigate a houston nonprofit to see whether it helped get governor rick perry reelected in 2006 the texas freedom network is accusing the niemoller foundation of funding partisan political efforts through the texas restoration project that were meant to help perry mobilize churches and their congregations to vote their logic the niemoller foundation funded the restoration project which held six events around the state with perry as the only invited gubernatorial candidate other speakers included lieutenant governor david dewhurst and railroad commissioner michael williams according to a perry spokesman the chairman of the restoration project rev laurence white of houston is a director of the foundation we couldnt immediately reach him for comment the foundations tax reports say it raised more than 12 million and name four substantial contributors  jim leininger of san antonio bob perry of houston bo pilgrim of pittsburg and don oneal of colleyville  who are all perry contributors and the foundation spent more than 470000 on consultants who also did substantial work for the texas gop a spokesman for perry says the restoration project did nothing overtly political other than encouraging people to vote tfn is a secularist leftist organization and does not like people of faith said robert black tough  asked what he meant by secularist black said the group believes that faith should not be in the public square  he says the restoration project never told people who to vote for and didnt campaign for perry the tfn complaint points to a list of pastors it says were used by the perry campaign for mailings the letter and the documents behind it are on the tfn website el pasos hd78 got a late addition to the ballot in joe moody an assistant district attorney and the son of bill moody the el paso judge who led the losing democratic ticket in 2006 the elder moodys results in each legislative district provide a rough measure of how the parties stack up in each locale we even did a handy chart last year which is in our files section hes local so the results are probably skewed but moody got 593 percent of the vote in that legislative district in 2006 but republican representative pat haggerty now holds it he frequently votes with the democrats in the house and probably wouldnt see a full press if he wins his primary but if his challenger dee margo is the republican nominee its likely to be a district both sides move to the top of the target list next fall representative dora olivo drosenberg will find some of her colleagues on the other side of the stage this year one of her opponents ron reynolds was an intern to senator rodney ellis dhouston at one time and got in the race at a point when some members thought olivo was going to retire she had a primary challenge in 2006 and won with 604 percent of the vote representative betty brown rterrell got the seasons first

The Annotated Ballot	2008-01-07	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2008/01/07/the-annotated-ballot/	en	leave out the presidential contest and only a handful of the 173 statewide and legislative races on the texas ballot are without incumbents and theyre all in the texas house every race on the statewide ballot has an incumbent republican in it but only one  texas court of criminal appeals judge cathy cochran  is running unopposed and three of the incumbents drew opponents from their own parties that group includes us senator john cornyn and two of cochrans court colleagues tom price and paul womack  texas has 32 members of congress and each of them is running for reelection there are six lucky ducks who drew no major party opposition two more have primary opponents but no major party opposition in november most  22  have no primary opponents but will face the other major partys candidate in november that leaves two from north texas who have opposition in their primaries and in the general election assuming they survive march us representatives sam johnson rplano and ralph hall rrockwall also of note there are 10 republicans in the cd22 primary battling for a chance to face us representative nick lampson dstafford in november ten really and ciro rodriguez dsan antonio has serious opposition in whats proven to be a competitive district bexar county commissioner lyle larsen and businessman francisco quico canseco are in the gop primary  all 15 senators on the ballot this year are seeking reelection we count seven lucky ducks two with primaries and no generals five with general elections and no primaries and one with opposition in march and november our counts here and elsewhere are based on unofficial ballots the parties have another ten days to pull their ballots together and there could be adds and drops candidates we dont know about and challenges that knock people out of the running three incumbents on the early watch list sens kim brimer rfort worth mike jackson rla porte and judith zaffirini dlaredo  the 2008 ballots have four former house members running for spots in that chamber including a former republican running as a democrat and a former democrat running as a republican only one of these matches is in a party primary democrat al edwards of houston wants his hd146 seat back and will run against representative borris miles who unseated him in november fourtermer todd hunter will try to unseat freshman representative juan garcia dcorpus christi in hd32 hunter serving as a democrat didnt seek reelection in 1998 now hes running as a republican in hd98 former representative nancy moffat of southlake wants a rematch with vicki truitt who knocked her out of office but moffat a former republican will run this time as a democrat and in hd107 in dallas former representative bill keffer a republican wants to unseat allen vaught the democrat who beat him in 2006  only nine of the people who were in the house last time it met are volunteering not to come back and both major parties have candidates in all but one of those races were including the hd97 seat filled by democrat dan barrett in a special election just before christmas roland gutierrez late of the san antonio city council is the only candidate who filed for the spot currently held by democratic representative robert puente  nearly half of the states representatives  64  wont see major party opposition this year another 17 have primaries but nothing waiting in november party doesnt seem to have much to do with that the house chapter of the lucky duck club includes 29 democrats and 35 republicans put another way 44 seats now held by republicans will be contested this year as against 42 seats now held by democrats candidates running for office in districts that cross county lines file with the state democratic and republican parties while those in districts that dont cross county lines file with their county parties long story short it takes a little bit for the parties to consolidate their county and state lists and some candidates whove filed might get knocked off the ballots and some arent eligible and some have their names spelled wrong on the party lists and so on weve consolidated what the state and local parties have put out so far and were updating as they do anyhow its all in one list available for download in our files section theres a date and time stamp at the top of each chart so you can tell what version youve got the two major parties have to certify their primary candidate lists for the texas secretary of state by january 14 and well update our lists  which consolidate the republican and democratic lists  as names are added and subtracted and other things change libertarians choose their candidates differently and will have their lists available later in the year their unofficial list is online here just after our last issue came out the attorney general issued a longawaited ruling on texas house antics the top prosecutor in the state capital called an end to his lovehate relationship with political rascals scalawags dopes saints losers and avid practitioners of the seven deadly sins and a democrat won an impossible election in fort worth other than that it was pretty quiet we covered all this in detail between issues in texas weeklys notebook so well do this in digest form here  the house makes and interprets its own rules and isnt subject to executive or judicial branch kibitzing according to ag greg abbott legal translation house speaker tom craddicks ruling that he cant be unseated or challenged to recognize members is up to the house they set their rules and conduct their own business political translation if house members dont like the rules andor want limits on the powers of the speaker thats up to them expect rules to become a talking point in the elections where this comes up if it does and in the contest for speaker a year from now secondly abbott says the courts would probably decide the speaker is a state official for legal purposes but he hedged his bet and anyhow opinions rendered by texas attorneys general have no power beyond persuasion but if its so one way to remove a speaker is through impeachment generally the house indicts and the senate convicts or acquits another is for twothirds of the house to vote to toss him or her that last bit would require the speaker to recognize the insurrectionists see the riff about house rules in the previous paragraph abbotts opinion doesnt change much but it should end the conversation from what happened last may to the subject of new house rules and what the next speaker  craddick or not  has the power to do more detail on the speakers power is at these links abbotts opinion the questions the arguments and reactions  travis county district attorney ronnie earle announced he wont seek reelection thats of statewide importance because the chief prosecutor in austin has jurisdiction over crimes committed in the course of texas politics the capitol and all that earle prosecuted former house speaker gib lewis dfort worth and is currently involved in a legal melee with former us majority leader tom delay rsugar land hes gone after others and missed including us senator kay bailey hutchison former attorney general jim mattox thencomptroller bob bullock and former land commissioner garry mauro everybody in the race to replace earle is a democrat who currently works for him that bunch includes gary cobb rosemary lehmberg mindy montford and rick reed  the newest state representative is a democratic attorney from fort worth named dan barrett who won a holiday runoff against republican mark shelton in what most everyone assumed was a republican district the texas weekly index in that district goes 236 points to the right meaning the average statewide democrat has lost to the average statewide republican by that many points in the last two elections barrett won the lowturnout runoff with 522 percent hes alone on the democratic side for a full term three republicans including shelton are vying for a crack at him in the general election in november  texas with two sites among the finalists for the futuregen project lost to illinois jewett and odessa were among the contenders for that clean coal project but the us department of energy gave the nod to mattoon illinois  the virtual moat around the texas capitol will become permanent with a new perimeter security plan theyll install retractable bollards  big thick posts that can stop traffic or be lowered to let it through theyll admit traffic at only one gate and theyll move a major bus stop they hope to replace the four 24hour guard posts that now control traffic at each of the entrances to the capitol grounds the estimated tab 33 million two house candidates are also state employees or were until this week republican donna keel and democrat diana maldonado both work for comptroller susan combs who has decided there are too many conflicts of interest running in contested house elections while working in an agency whose budget and some policies are controlled by the legislature the rule were told is that employees who run can go on leave if theyre in contested primaries  they could be available to work again if things dont go well in march  but have to leave the agency to run in november elections keel whos challenging representative valinda bolton daustin in hd47 is outta there so is maldonado whos running for an open seat in round rock where republican representative mike krusee decided not to seek reelection neither woman has a primary opponent  senator mike jackson rla porte has enemies off the ballot as well as on it the texas league of conservation voters launched a toxic mike jackson website trashtalking the incumbent on clean air and environmental issues hell face a democrat to be named later in november after a twoman democratic primary in march  the sd21 race started with a little spice from the incumbent senator judith zaffirini dlaredo welcomed democrat rene barrientos to the race by sending reporters a photo she took of the gate to his ranch its got a political sign posted for republican candidate louis bruni wholl face the winner of the democratic primary the money quote guests at my november reception in la salle county were surprised to see brunis campaign sign by the gate of barrientos la golondrina ranch indicating that he sees the handwriting on the wall and expects to lose my democratic opponent apparently is supporting my republican opponent and my republican opponent doesnt understand that this is a democratic district   susan criss mightve pulled the trigger too early her camp said before the filing deadline that democratic opponent linda yaez didnt have the right number of signatures to run against her for a spot on the texas supreme court but yaez got busy collecting signatures and says now that she cured the problem before the deadline the winner of that primary will face republican justice phil johnson in november  former frisco mayor kathy seei joined the cd4 race  us representative ralph hall rrockwall is the incumbent  with signatures rather than with a fee  jim mcgrody a republican who entered and then exited the cd23 race in san antonio says hell support bexar county commissioner lyle larson in the gop primary the winner in that march contest will face us representative ciro rodriguez dsan antonio in november  the difference between a goof and a spoof isnt always clear in a press release announcing his hd129 candidacy against representative john davis rhouston republican jon keeney of taylor lake village says republicans have to clean their own house or the democrats will do it for them  it seems the incumbents in austin have been consumed by the same problems as congress  he says in the press release but that sentence has a phrase crossed out the earlier version  it seems the incumbents in austin have been drinking the same kool aid consumed by congress  it turned out to be a goof they went with the first version in a later press release  texas railroad commission candidate dale henry starts with an endorsement from state representative garnet coleman dhouston who called him the most progressive candidate in the race  henry running as a democrat ran previously as a republican if he wins the primary his two opponents are art hall of san antonio and mark thompson of hamilton hell face railroad commissioner michael williams and will at the very least grab a footnote hell apparently be the first person to run against every single member of a sitting railroad commission henry already lost to republican elizabeth ames jones in the 2006 general election and to victor carrillo in the 2004 gop primary  tom craddick has his first election opponent in years city councilman bill dingus is the candidate and hell be running as a conservative democrat craddick first elected in 1968 last had an opponent in 2000 when he beat democrat gilberto garcia 783 percent to 217 percent  el paso representative pat haggerty will run again and as a republican in spite of rumors that he might switch parties and he threw in a curve ball hell be a candidate for speaker of the house whether that holds is anyones guess but it puts his republican challenger dee margo in a spot haggertys the only candidate in the race talking about having a speaker from el paso the last one was in the 1920s and it lets haggerty rag on speaker tom craddick without saying hes for a democrat or for a republican whose campaign is backed by democrats  james shepherd a former richardson city councilman and school board member won endorsements from senator john carona representative fred hill who has the seat now and isnt seeking another term and from county commissioner mike cantrell of garland carona and hill will do an austin funder for shepherd thats a threeway primary angie button and randy dunning are both from garland  mike pearce one of the republicans running for dianne white delisis spot in hd55 wins endorsements from two members of the state board of education ken mercer and gail lowe both say theyll support the former public school teacher candidates dont officially report their finances until midmonth but us senate candidate rick noriega a democrat says he raised about

Who's Subsidizing Whom?	2007-07-16	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2007/07/16/whos-subsidizing-whom/	en	the states biggest phone companies and their competitors are fighting over a fund that subsidizes companies that provide phone service where it would otherwise be unaffordable att the biggest says the universal service fund doesnt cover its costs competitors say the company gets at least twice what it should and the public utility commission is getting ready to referee hoping to refresh the formulas for the usf before the legislature comes back for a regular session in january 2009 texas weeklys staff is taking their annual summer break daily news clips will continue and the newsletter will return in the first week of august see you then att says its not paid enough for highcost services the state requires it to provide the companies on the other side say their customers are being taxed to help ma bell remain in a dominant position theres a pile of money at stake about 425 million was disbursed last year to the phone companies in the biggest program within the usf according to a recent puc report the fund is financed with a fee on your phone bill and all of the phone companies have to take part the money is supposed to subsidize highcost customers who otherwise wouldnt get phones an easy example it costs a fortune on a percustomer basis to build and operate phone service in those long mostly uninhabited parts of west texas but the big phone companies agreed to do it if they could use money from highprofit areas to cover the costs with competition coming into play that subsidy turned into the usf the notion was that the profitable areas would have lots of companies competing and their customers the state decided should pay into a kitty to keep the phones running in unprofitable areas its a state program and a tax buried in a regulated industry texas wants the companies to provide phone service everywhere thats the program and it sets the rate on a fee the companies collect  theres your tax  which is then distributed to the program providers the phone companies by a private company that serves the same function the state comptroller serves in most programs collecting and distributing the funds the formulas were last set in 1999 based on numbers from 1997 the biggest recipient att formerly sbc formerly southwestern bell etc serves the greatest number of highcost areas and theyre paid based on what those tenyearold financial models say they should get but some areas that were rural ten years ago are suburban now and profitable for the phone companies three smaller companies also get usf money for highcost areas they serve and more companies are competing for various businesses including oldfashioned land lines wireless phones television and on and on and on a coalition of those competitors has been pressing for a change in the formulas for several years and now hope the puc will get something new in place by this time next year thats a group that includes the texas cable and telecommunications association time warner telecom and sprintnextel among others they dont want to kill the usf but they fear att and others are getting more money than they need to serve those highcost areas and want to make sure the usf money going to those companies isnt being used to competitive advantage the companies getting the money dont have to prove they spent it in highcost areas and dont have to detail their expenses in order to get reimbursed the opposition wants to make sure they get the money they need and no more and that they use it for the purposes intended on the other side att verizon windstream and embarq say theyve got the disadvantage of being the providers of last resort and as such have no choice but to make sure everyone in the state has access to phone service att  the 300pound gorilla here  contends the usf reimbursements dont cover the costs of the services they provide a spokesman says flatly that theyre undercompensated for the services theyre required to provide in highcost areas and they contend the cable companies and others want to hobble the phone company so itll be a weaker competitor the pucs been at this for a while but the case is expected to really get going in september and the agency could have a decision as early as next spring according to their current timetables mikal watts personally gave more than 500000 to political candidates and committees over the last halfdecade the biggest chunks went to three political action committees the good government pac 125000 the texas trial lawyers association pac 111700 and the save texas courts pac 75000 that last one was set up to oppose a constitutional amendment limiting lawsuits by former supreme court justice deborah hankinson a republican the ttla pac is a longrunning operation that gets money from lawyers all over the state for political candidates but the good government pac is closely associated with watts and its the source of charges that he has supported republican candidates as well as democrats hes given smaller amounts to several candidates including his favorite candidate by a mile sandra watts a state district judge to whom hes contributed 104751 shes also his mom the good government pac gets most of its money from watts and from his law firm and shares their business address in corpus christi since 2004 the googoo pac fdr and others called good government advocates googoos gave 40000 to lieutenant governor david dewhurst 15000 to attorney general greg abbott and 5000 each to chief justice wallace jefferson and state representative phil king of weatherford according to campaign finance records at the texas ethics commission it supported former representatives talmadge heflin of houston and toby goodman of arlington in their unsuccessful reelection bids but most of its money went to democrats or against republicans for juan garcia against gene seaman in last years fight over a corpus christi statehouse seat for senator kirk watson daustin then in a race for attorney general for chris bell against rick perry and carole keeton strayhorn and kinky friedman in last years gubernatorial election and they were a drag on former representative jaime capelo dcorpus christi helping knock off the incumbent in a 2004 primary its also a contributor to other pacs giving 100000 to the austinbased hillco pac run by lobbyist buddy jones and his associates on the federal front contributions amounts are limited but watts has been busy for the last several years according to records with the federal election commission hes a contributor to several presidential campaigns  john edwards now and four years ago to john kerry after hed put edwards on his ticket in 2004 and to joe biden last year watts also gave to edwards 2002 campaign for us senate barrack obama now a presidential candidate got a donation from watts for his 2004 senate race hes given to us sens and senate candidates ron kirk ddallas barbara boxer dcalifornia tom harkin diowa jon tester dmontana robert menendez dnew jersey tom daschle dnorth dakota harry reid dnevada tony knowles dalaska and ken salazar dcolorado watts contributed to us representatives former representatives and house candidates chet edwards dwaco ted poe rhumble solomon ortiz dcorpus christi richard raymond dlaredo henry cuellar dlaredo ron chapman ddallas lloyd doggett daustin martin frost ddallas and nick lampson dstafford poe a former houston judge was the only republican we spotted on watts federal giving list mikal watts threw a bunch of his own money into his senate bid but his fundraising brought in 11 million from other peoples bank accounts the san antonio democrat says he raised that much in the first 30 days after forming his senate committee and said the campaign reached the end of june with 49 million on hand the rest came from the candidate himself his campaign said 400000 of the money came from online contributions the republican incumbent us senator john cornyn hasnt released his midyear financial report and aides arent saying much about whatll be in that document but a spokesman david beckwith said his boss will be in the lead if watts wants to keep up with us hes gonna have to write another check  separately watts has started staffing up adding jason stanford of austin to the juggernaut to do research and also some speechwriting and kim devlin wholl handle communications sherry boyles a onetime democratic candidate for texas railroad commissioner and former head of annies list is handling some of watts fundraising railroad commissioner michael williams hasnt filed his midyear reports yet but aides say he raised 322000 in ten days an amount they think is a record for a railroad commissioner williams like other state officeholders was barred from raising money while the legislature was in session and while governor rick perry was in the 20day window for approving and vetoing bills after the session ended williams is also set to announce endorsements from fourfifths of the members of the state republican executive committee hes the state gops former general counsel and from 100 of his partys county chairmen heres a weird bit of trivia he might draw opposition in next years election from dale henry who ran as a republican against victor carrillo and as a democrat against elizabeth ames jones in the last two election cycles that would apparently make henry the only guy to run against every sitting member of a texas railroad commission  dan grant a democrat challenging us representative mike mccaul raustin in cd10 says he raised 72700 in the last month no report yet its not due from the incumbent grant worked as a civilian setting up new government operations in both afghanistan and iraq and consulted for the john kerry presidential campaign he poses himself as a foreign policy expert   another early announcement joe jaworski a galveston democrat challenging state senator mike jackson rla porte in sd11 says hell report more than 250000 in his campaign accounts at midyear that total includes 214495 he says he raised during the last six months nonofficeholders arent barred from raising money during legislative sessions as incumbents are  texans for public justice reports based on info at the texas ethics commission that house speaker tom craddick had nearly 42 million in the bank at the beginning of the year and was sitting on nearly that much during last years election cycle but he didnt spend much contributing less than 200000 to the political action committees that were defending his supporters in their reelection bids last year tpj says in their report a california company has pulled together a database that tries to do for charities what campaign finance databases do for politics and theres some interesting overlap noza pulls together public information from charities around the us and makes it searchable so you can find out for instance who in texas gave money to a particular charity and about how much they gave its not completely hard data the numbers depend on what the charities reveal about themselves and their donors but if someone gives and the organization lists them as a donor  often done and often with dollar ranges  they end up in the database craig harris a former nonprofit exec set the website up to help other nonprofits get information that could help them raise money if you give to one outfit and end up in the database other similar outfits will know youre out there and can hit you up for contributions to their causes that opens a potential tie to politics and political giving an avenue the companys now pursuing if someone gives to a particular charities or charities and hasnt been active politically its possible to make an educated guess about their politics and their finances its not a new idea  back in the day karl rove for instance had direct mail businesses in politics and in fine arts and found some useful overlaps there and corporate america has been using crossindexing like this for years but it hasnt been this easy to access about a third of the database doesnt have dollar values attached usually because the charities listed their donors without numbers but thats potentially useful too since it links names to causes and to other gifts that might have bucks enumerated harris says hes still aimed mainly at the nonprofit business but says political campaigns and candidates are starting to poke into the data so he says are reporters who want to know more about contributors and about the candidates themselves and who they give to check it out wwwnozasearchcom  while were at it theres a new website thats basically in existence to collect dirt on presidential candidates you click on a candidate to find out whats going on with them and you can click on another link to add to the muck sheesh wwwoppodepotcom representative rick noriega dhouston was all set to announce his bid for us senate but will delay that event until monday out of respect for lady bird johnson and he didnt say for the simple fact that all of the political press will be busy this weekend with that funeral hell jump into the democratic primary against san antonio lawyer mikal watts next week the winner of that primary  next march  will likely face the incumbent us senator john cornyn a san antonio republican  debra coffey a fort worth republican got the drop on everyone in hd97 filing papers designating a

looking hard at a return to the texas house if he jumps and if hes successful hed be succeeding his successor a leonard confederate tells us that mowery  then a republican activist  was one of the

comptroller and former fbi agent says hell keep the door open for future contests but wont play this time out he hasnt decided who hell support and says hes heard of five or six democrats who are considering the race youd think legislators would want to hog credit for state employee pay raises youd be wrong they put a small increase in pay in the budget but made it contingent on the comptroller saying the money was there to pay for the thing everybody knew the money was there the state has more than 7 billion in uncommitted money in the treasury anyhow comptroller susan combs officially says the money is there for a raise when the budget starts in september state employees will get a two percent hike then and another two percent hike a year later law enforcement officers will get bigger increases the total tab for that is 4024 million during the next budget cycle on a micro level someone making 40000 a year now will be making 41616 two years hence  quico canseco a

Unexpected Endings	2007-04-30	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2007/04/30/unexpected-endings/	en	a house committee bungled its votes on divorce and abortion bills killing a couple of the sessions most controversial issues house state affairs chairman david swinford rdumas called for a vote with six of the nine members of his committee gathered around his desk on the house floor there were three bills up for approval and each got four yups and two nopes but you have to have a hard majority to move a bill thats five votes in this case and because the two legislators who voted no wont change their votes two of the bills are finished and the third is alive only because its senate twin passed the socalled trigger bill that outlaws abortion in texas if the roe v wade decision is overturned by the us supreme court wont go to the full house that legislation hb 175 had other problems  keep reading  but representative warren chisum rpampa hoped to get it to the floor of the house for a debate next was another chisum bill  one that made it to the floor only to be sent back to committee on a point of order he wanted to make marriage more durable by making divorce more difficult slowing the time between breakups and legal divorces and allowing couples to speed up the proceedings by going through counseling or by proving thered been violence at home the conflict resolution training he and other supporters figure would keep couples together opponents said it would create an unreasonably long wait  two years  before couples could split the bill hb 2684 made it to the floor earlier this month but a rules violation sent it back to swinfords committee where it died chisum said he hopes to attach the bill as an amendment to something else before the session ends the third bill killed in swinfords committee lives on but only because the senates version passed it would require doctors to report abortions and details about them to state health officials and would require the state to put out an annual report on the statistics representative geanie morrison rvictoria is still playing because the senate narrowly okayed sb 785 by senator florence shapiro rplano thats on its way to the house the goof gets house members off the hook on two big controversies they dont have to vote one way or the other on those issues that inspired some speculation that somebody was trying to protect the house from voting on the bills but swinford insists he screwed up and that he had intended to vote all three measures out of his committee two democrats  jessica farrar dhouston and marc veasey dfort worth  voted against all three bills at least one and maybe all three members who missed the vote  all of them republicans  could have been counted on to provide the fifth vote to move the bills to the floor but the only way to repair the vote is to get someone on the prevailing side to allow reconsideration veasey said hed been asked but he said no hes winning it would cost more than 500 million annually in state and federal funds to make abortions illegal in texas according to an estimate from the legislative budget board thats the price tag that agency put on a socalled trigger bill that would make abortions illegal in texas if the us supreme court overturns its decadesold ruling in roe v wade put another way  a less delicate one  thats the legislative estimate of how much money the states taxpayers save because of texas current abortion laws it would cost around 200 million annually in state funds and another 300 million in federal funds if abortions were illegal in the state according to the lbbs fiscal note on hb 175 thats based on the cost of the state medical and aid services those children would require if they were born and doesnt include schooling and other programs the arithmetic is macabre the analysts took the states abortion rate from 2003 and estimated the number of abortions that would take place in the future based on that rate and the number of childbearingage women in the state in the future their calculation is that there will be 78718 abortions in 2008 rising to 82828 by 2012 they assumed 20 percent of pregnant women seeking abortions would go out of state if abortions were illegal here and that another one percent would have abortions here based on health of the mother or the fetus the other 79 percent more babies would be born for the year 2010 they estimated 64224 more births wheres the cost to the government medicaid and other services more than half of the births in texas  around 55 percent  are paid for medicaid or were in 2005 the year used for the estimate the analysts assumed some percentage of those kids would be eligible for medicaid and other aid programs and services beyond their first birthday they didnt include costs like public schools and the like in the first full biennial budget after such a change in law the lbb estimates the state would spend 4165 million in state funds and another 5914 million in federal funds on those programs the total tab which would rise each year after that starts at 101 billion the high numbers alone probably killed the bills chance of becoming law though it died in committee because of a mistake described elsewhere and its unusual that the lbb hit it with the big price tag since the sponsor is appropriations chairman warren chisum rpampa who shares oversight of the lbb with his senate counterpart chisum said hes not concerned about the fiscal note and said the flip side of the argument is that the state is saving money by allowing abortions hed rather pay he said the senates five budgeteers will be steve ogden rbryan judith zaffirini dlaredo robert duncan rlubbock john whitmire dhouston and tommy williams rthe woodlands ogden chairs the senate finance committee zaffirini is the vice chair lieutenant governor david dewhurst announced his picks more than a week after the house team was named and a day after the senate passed its version of jessicas law the two bills had become politically entwined despite the differences in subject matter jessicas law is dewhursts pet issue this session and he wanted votes republicans in particular were lobbying for a conservative makeup on the budget conference committee in the end a conference committee seat that might have belonged to senator kip averitt rwaco went to williams who is regarded by some republicans as the more conservative of the two a handful of those conservatives lobbied against reappointing averitt and duncan  both of whom were on the committee two years ago  in favor of someone further to the right dewhurst asked by a reporter whether whining is the best way to get on the conference committee said he considered several possibilities before making his decision about who gets to play whine to the lieutenant governor i dont know that ive ever heard senator ogden or senator williams or senator duncan whine to the lieutenant governor  the five senators will start talks this week with their counterparts from the house warren chisum rpampa chairman of the appropriations committee dan gattis rgeorgetown ryan guillen drio grande city vice chairman of appropriations lois kolkhorst rbrenham and sylvester turner dhouston the legislative budget board has posted a simplified sidebyside comparing the two bills the bottom lines are 21 billion apart largely because the senate included money to pay for increased health and human services for children to satisfy terms of a federal lawsuit settlement the upper chamber also included acrosstheboard cuts in state government to pay for that settlement so their budget would still be bigger without the court orders the difference in general revenue spending  thats most of the state money in the budget  is 5927 million so theyre close but theres plenty to fight over some key differences in the bills the house voted for acrosstheboard pay raises for teachers in place of incentive pay the senate wants to build prisons that the house didnt include the house included a quality assurance fee on nursing homes that senators regard as a politically dangerous granny tax and the two bodies disagree on how often people should reapply for benefits from the childrens health insurance program which is both a policy and finance decision the senate put more money into school buildings while the house spent more on education technology the house would raise the states contributions to teacher retirement by 160 million and state employee retirement by 58 million the senate has more money in state employee health insurance programs the senate wants more for community colleges and healthrelated higher education the house put more into medical grad schools and border security the senate has more money on criminal justice for teens including fixes for the texas youth commission the senate included money for water and air plans the house has contingency funding for the film industry legislators agreed on a ban on gubernatorial orders to vaccinate preteen girls against human papillomavirus or hpv that legislation goes next to governor rick perry whose mandate is being challenged here perry wants girls vaccinated against hpv before they enter sixth grade unless their parents for whatever reason opt out his order issued as the legislature began the session angered some conservatives hpv is a sexually transmitted disease in addition to being a leading cause of cervical cancer as well as some legislators who dont think the guv has the power to force the shots or to order the state to pay for them that sends the bill to the governor with plenty of time for lawmakers to overrule him if he decides to veto it and the votes are there the senate approved the bill 301 the house concurred with a vote of 1352 it takes twothirds to override a veto the version sent to perry includes a fouryear ban on mandates from the governor to vaccinate texas girls against human papillomavirus perry wanted to make the threeshot vaccinations a condition for girls entering the sixth grade in texas public schools the houses version of the state budget has another version of the ban in it it says none of the money in that spending plan can be used to pay for vaccinations ordered by perry now that the house voted to require voters to show photo identification and a voter registration card to vote thats off to the senate where an absent senator at the right moment could decide the outcome the house tally was a partyline affair nearly with the democrats in the room voting against it and all but two republicans voting for it the two republicans who sided with the democrats were representatives delwin jones rlubbock and tommy merritt rlongview the bill passed 7668 now it gets really interesting when the late senator greg luna dsan antonio was dying he got thenlieutenant governor rick perry to agree to a deal perry would give him 24 hours notice if the senate was going to vote on a voucher bill carried by thensenator teel bivins ramarillo fast forward to the present day senator mario gallegos dhouston has asked lieutenant governor david dewhurst for the same deal on the voter id bill gallegos who had a liver transplant earlier this year has sporadically attended this regular session and in the senate business is business if a senator who can block your bill isnt in the room its time to ask the lite guv to let you bring that bill up for a vote dewhurst is giving the luna precedent a narrow reading he wrote to gallegos in january saying hes happy to provide you with 24 hours notice one time for a vote on a single piece of legislation you designate in writing  dewhurst said he cant imagine a scenario  other than on redistricting issues in special sessions  when he would waive the senates rule that requires a twothirds vote of the members present before a piece of legislation can come up to a vote there are some legal workarounds but theyre politically unsound so much for the brimer theory senator kim brimer rfort worth managed to amend a transportation bill to include a clause indexing state gasoline taxes to inflation the big deal  as pointed out by senator florence shapiro rplano  is that tax bills have to originate in the house brimers gasoline tax amendment  added to omnibus transportation legislation authored by senator john carona rdallas  drew nays from shapiro and senator robert nichols rjacksonville sens rodney ellis dhouston and tommy williams rthe woodlands did not vote but everyone else voted for it according to the brimer theory tax language can originate in the senate so long as it does not constitute the main body of the bill are you sure  asked shapiro i dont have to be sure answered brimer it will be an interesting parliamentary discussion carona said but one worthy of having  not mollified shapiro said im not in the business of spending time debating whether its their turn or our turn i think the constitution  its pretty clear on this issue  shapiro did succeed in blocking a second tax amendment by brimer that would have allowed dallas and surrounding counties to bust the sales tax cap currently at 825 percent and raise it to 875 percent to fund roads not wanting any amendment that would preclude his bill from passing committee unanimously carona asked brimer to withdraw that one senate parliamentarian karina casaridavis weighed in on brimers two amendments telling carona before the meeting that the gas tax should not originate in the senate but the sales tax cap buster could the committee held up a vote on the bill to go to session  giving brimer enough time to ruminate chew a cigar or two and change his mind its been overridden by the parliamentarian it was a shortlived theory he said sounds like a brimer theory laughed house ways  means committee chair jim keffer reastland when told about brimers initial reasoning brimer said the gas tax amendment wont be included in sb 1929 when it goes to the full senate and said he was trying to prompt the house to improve transportation funding keffer said hes not aware of any desire in the house to either increase the statewide gas tax or the sales tax in the metroplex caronas bill covered here last week includes the twoyear private toll road moratorium prescribed by nichols sb 1267 already approved by the senate it restricts noncompete clauses in road contracts requires transparency in bidding includes a landowners bill of rights gives local authorities more power to control road projects and creates rural planning organizations like the ones already in place for cities the bill also allots 25 million in money from terp a cleanair initiative to start fixing the morass called tower 55 a major rail intersection in downtown fort worth brimer backed up by union pacifics ron olsen said trains from all four corners of the compass have to wait their turn to cross tower 55 idling all the while blocking automobile traffic and constituting hazardous playground equipment for nearby elementary school kids ellis added an incentive program for people to buy hybrid vehicles three things to keep an eye on that could become part of the bill 1 a study of metropolitan planning organizations suggested by shapiro 2 a limit on the number or total dollar amount of comprehensive development agreements entered into by the state and 3 a provision by eliot shapleigh del paso blocking txdot from staking out a road project indefinitely preventing anyone else from building that particular road by patrick brendel the democratic senate campaign committee has a poll that says us senator john cornyn rtexas is beatable in next years elections and while they were sending that to reporters with one hand their other hand was sending the same info to texas donors suggesting they send some money to the washington dc outfit to get some democrats elected according to the dscc cornyn would get 47 percent to a generic democrats 38 percent in an election held now the pollsters  hamilton beattie  staff  said voters are split when asked if theyd be better off with republicans or democrats in charge of congress about half think the countrys headed the wrong way while a third think thins are on the right track cornyns name id is 39 percent  threefifths of texans cant identify him but probably know who sanjaya malakar is of those however 41 percent have a favorable impression of the states junior senator as against 19 percent who think negatively of him their spin cornyns vulnerable cornyn spokesman david beckwith said his guys 2to1 favorable to unfavorable rating is a strong sign the national democratic campaign committee is looking to sap texas trial lawyers for their money to be used in other states they know cornyn is strong because they havent been able to find anyone to run against him  other stuff of interest governor rick perry is viewed favorably by 52 percent of the people surveyed unfavorably by 39 percent hes only unknown by 5 percent compared to 33 percent for cornyn the survey attached indicates the firm tried out five other names on respondents but didnt share them with the press the poll was done april 1115 pollsters got responses from 800 selfidentified registered voters who are certain to vote in 2008 they said the surveys margin of error is  35 percent the poll comes on the heels of a fundraiser for dscc at the san antonio home of attorney mikal watts where the organization says it raised 11 million texas democrats say theyve had some assurances that money will be used in texas if cornyn has a viable opponent a bunch of names have been floated though nobody has publicly jumped into the race cornyn meanwhile put out a list of the people who are helping him raise money around the state it includes john nau state finance chair houston john schweitzer and karen johnson austin robert rowling and george seay dallas kit moncrief and dee kelly jr

run of success that dominated thursday morning office conversation for several weeks now get back to work former us senator fred thompson of tennessee would tie for second with us senator john mccain of arizona in a texas republican presidential primary held today according to a survey by austinbased baselice  associates his survey done april 1619 has former new york city mayor rudy giuliani in the lead with 24 percent followed by thompson and mccain with 19 percent each former us representative newt gingrich of georgia with 12 percent former massachusetts governor mitt romney with 8 percent and a mess of people with less than that undecided got 12 percent tied with gingrich one interesting thing about the poll 831 respondents  34 percent margin of error is how it compares with an earlier survey that didnt include thompson while he was going from zero to 19 percent everyone but romney was losing numbers possibly to thompson possibly to each other compared with the earlier poll giuliani lost four percentage points mccain lost seven and gingrich lost five even undecided lost some falling from 16 percent in the earlier poll sometimes youll see reporters bear down on their notebooks when theyre expecting something to happen some were paying attention when representative jim keffer reastland asked colleagues to approve a calendar rule to keep the crows from pecking his tax bill to death thats the legislation that fixes mistakes in last years tax bill and its a potential magnet for lobbyists who want to score a tax break for their clients but keffers mojo was good he got his rule with a comfortable 10926 margin the reporters put their notebooks down a good sign for keffer that bill comes up next week it would let about 60000 businesses out of the margins tax by raising the annual gross receipts floor to 600000 its currently 300000 the national federation for independent business is pushing for a 1 million floor and for a lower tax rate it changes a mistake on taxes

General Election: The House	2006-06-04	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2006/06/04/general-election-the-house/	en	more than half of the members of the next house  79 to be precise  have already been determined barring accidents bizarre upsets or other side effects our doctors havent told us about we count only 20 races that on paper could be competitive including 13 where the incumbents success has been a clear exception to local voting patterns thats out of a bigger field of contested races including 41 involving republican incumbents 18 involving democratic incumbents and an even dozen where the incumbent got beat in the primary or didnt run for reelection most of the races  as in the congressional delegation and the state senate  were won or lost to one party or the other when the maps were drawn after the last census if were right about whats hot and whats not only about 10 percent of the seats in the house will turn over due to electoral violence more will flip probably due to retirements and higher ambitions both sides have their hopes republicans look at the last election results and see 13 seats that were held by democrats even though the same voters supported george w bush and on average all other republicans running statewide those blue shirts in red territory are the stuff targets are made of democrats are looking at the same numbers but with two environmental changes bush who was popular in texas two years ago wont be on the ballot this year and the race getting all the attention this year  the one for guv  features a democrat a republican an independent and an independent whose been on the ballot as a republican for the last several election cycles bushs presence two years ago helped downballot republicans in close contests a boost they wont have this year and the people in the business of plotting gubernatorial campaigns seem to unanimously assume the states next ceo will get into office with less than 50 percent of the total vote its hard to count on the coattails of someone who doesnt get a majority of the vote republicans have the edge in numbers eleven democrats face potentially tough reelection battles compared to five republicans three openseat races could be noisy two of them to replace incumbent democrats and one to replace a republican depending on the mood of voters in five months the balance in the house could change by four to five seats either way right now there are 86 republicans and 64 democrats even in the worst likely scenario the gop will hang onto its house majority well start this with the list of potentially interesting contests and then list the seats that are already decided thats 99 races the rest are contested but wont get on the scope unless somebody makes a big mistake were listing 20 races here though the list of serious contests usually shrinks as elections near and there are a handful on this list that we wouldnt include if we were betting our own money even if all these races prove to be lively its a puny number of contests less than 13 percent of house races fit this generous definition of competitiveness if voters turn away more than 10 percent of the house in november  thats 15 seats  itll be remarkable when labor day comes this list will surely be smaller some of these folks wont raise enough money to contend at least one will do something stupid to kill his or her own campaign at least one will do something smart to knock the wind out of the opponent and several while they look good or semigood on paper now may turn out to be getting more attention here than they will ever get again with those caveats were watching these matchups the folks known as wd40s  white democrats over the age of 40  are on the gop target list again the group includes mark homer of paris who squeaked in with 508 percent 217 votes over kirby hollingsworth two years ago this is a rematch in hd3 a district that saw 623 percent of voters on average voting for statewide republicans two years ago chuck hopson of jacksonville is running against larry durrett a personally wealthy potentially selffunding republican whos son ran for the same office several years ago hopson got 527 percent last time in hd11 where voters like bush and republicans in general bush got 712 percent of the vote statewide republicans averaged 658 percent in hd12 jim mcreynolds of lufkin will face jody anderson also of lufkin in another wd40 contest mcreynolds got 51 percent last time against former state representative billy clemons bush won 664 percent of the vote in 2004 statewides got 603 percent robby cook of eagle lake was supposed to be in trouble last time around in hd17 and got 548 percent of the vote after briefly considering a partyswitch and also a retirement its another upsidedown district bush got 683 percent in 2004 and statewide republicans averaged 603 percent mike tuffy hamilton rmauriceville represents hd19  the same kind of district the wd40s represent hes got a rematch against democrat paul clayton who ran against him four years ago its republican turf but some democrats are promoting the contest bush was 683 percent statewide gops got 603 percent in hd32 republican gene seaman faces a challenge from a democrat juan garcia with navy flier and harvard law school credentials its a republican district surrounded by democratic turf and for what its worth almost 31 percent of the voters have hispanic surnames the arguments over immigration could take a funny bounce in a contest like this one bush got 668 percent statewides got 625 percent yvonne gonzalestoureilles of alice won a nailbiter two years ago and her hd35 is upside down bush got 592 statewides got 517 percent her opponent is michael esparza also of alice in hd45 democrat patrick rose of dripping springs is holding what looks like a red seat but hes made peace with republican financiers in the tort reform movement and this is safer ground than it was a couple of years ago his opponent is jim neuhaus of san marcos republican terry keel of austin quit to run for judge leaving an hd47 contest between republican bill welch who came within smelling distance in another race in austin in 1992 and valinda bolton a democrat making her first contest the district is numerically like two other austinarea districts that have been closely fought during the last two elections bush got 533 percent and statewide republicans got 534 percent one of those is hd48 where democrat donna howard beat republican ben bentzin in a special election earlier this year november is a rematch of the two the other is hd50 where democrat mark strama got 505 percent of the vote two years ago while bush was getting 513 percent and statewide republicans were getting 512 percent but strama was challenging an incumbent republican then and hes the officeholder this time jeff fleece is the republican in the race david farabee dwichita falls was supposed to be a cooked goose by now but hes held on in hd69 where bush got 726 percent and statewides got 683 percent two years ago farabee once again faces republican shirley craft hd85 has had the distinction for a couple of cycles now of being the most republican district in the state represented in the statehouse by a democrat former house speaker pete laney decided not to seek reelection and this year will test whether the split personality of the district was all about him jim landroop of plainview is the republican the democrat is joe heflin of crosbyton numbers bush got 763 percent statewide republicans got 68 percent and one thatll surprise some folks the district is 281 percent hispanic democrats have their eyes on toby goodman rarlington but its republican territory or was in 2004 bush got 567 percent statewide republicans got 551 percent the democrat in the contest is paula hightower pierson who did four terms on the arlington city council tony goolsby rdallas got a scare two years ago from democrat harriet miller and shes back the republican got 532 percent while bush was getting 562 percent and statewide republicans were pulling an average of 568 percent it was a sleeper race two years ago its on the radar for both parties this time carlos urestis decision to challenge senator frank madla of san antonio in the democratic primary paid off for him but opened his house seat as a possibility for republicans it was under water two years ago barely bush got 547 statewides got 503 uresti an incumbent got 568 percent but this time theres no incumbent republican george antua faces joe farias and both parties think its winnable david mcquade leibowitz dsan antonio just knocked off representative ken mercer two years ago getting 507 percent of the vote hes got incumbency on his side in a district thats mildly republican bush got 551 percent and statewide republicans got 514 percent the republican this time is ted kenyon an attorney and engineer joaquin castro didnt have an opponent in the general election in 2004 but hell face republican nelson balido this time in a district that barely favored bush 516 percent and barely favored democrats in statewide races 483 percent martha wong of houston is a top protection race for the republicans and a top target for democrats its a republican district but not overwhelmingly and the democrat ellen cohen is wellknown for her work running a shelter for women and children dont be surprised by lots of money and attention from both sides well end the list with a rematch of the only race that got appealed to the house two years ago democrat hubert vo of houston will defend himself against former appropriations chairman talmadge heflin who he beat by at least 10 but less than 20 votes last time that margin was the conclusion of a report done for an election contest between the two heflin dropped out of the contest when he saw the report the district is marginally republican but its not clear how much money heflin will be able to raise now that hes no longer the chief budget guy in the house a safe election here is one where only one of the major parties has a candidate several of these folks face libertarians and might face other minorparty candidates but they appear ready to measure curtains for their offices its safe to assume theyll be voting on whatever you care about next year safe republican incumbents 31 charles

edwards the races for texas senate are even less dramatic than the anemic congressional contests nine senators have no major party opposition no slight meant to the libertarians or the greens but neither party has ever put someone in the texas legislature that list includes three new senatorsapparent glenn hegar rkaty robert nichols rjacksonville and kirk watson daustin six incumbents are on that list kip averitt rwaco bob deuell rgreenville rodney ellis dhouston kevin eltife rtyler kyle janek rhouston and florence shapiro rplano that leaves only seven races and its hard to find people

conaway rmidland henry cuellar dlaredo lloyd doggett daustin charlie gonzalez dsan antonio al green dhouston and silvestre reyes del paso the other 26 seats are all contested but most of them wont keep the incumbents awake at night only one  tom delays  is open itll be one of the seriously contested seats too with former us representative nick lampson a democrat facing a candidate to be named later by the republican powers in the four counties that have a slice of the district delays last day at work is a week away republican party people will replace him on the ballot some time after that most expect it to happen quickly but if the smokefilled rooms clog up they have until early september to get a name on the ballot the other serious race at this point is in cd17 where us representative chet edwards dwaco is in a biennial fight to wear a blue jersey in red territory he faces van taylor a potentially wellfinanced republican who moved to west after a military stint the district favors republicans and so far edwards in 2004 while the average statewide republican was getting 663 percent of the votes in that district edwards got 519 percent in an expensive and hotly contested race put it another way at least 50939 people voted for republican george w bush for president his ranch in crawford is in the district and then switched sides and voted for edwards upsets are always possible but the rest of the congressional districts have incumbents from the parties those districts were designed to elect republicans in republican territory and democrats in democratic territory one caveat a decision on the constitutionality of the texas congressional districts is pending before the us supreme court traditionally the court releases opinions in late june and early july should they find problems with the lines here they could order up a new map and a new set of primaries something like that could make the top of the ballot interesting in places like dallas south texas and the valley the first year of the school property tax cut wont be affected by changes in the value of your property but future cuts could be the legislation passed during the special session cuts local school property tax rates by 113 percent next year independent of what your property value does a year later theres another cut that brings the total cut in rates to 33 percent if you start at 150 that puts you at 1 but property owners will start seeing the fluctuations in values by then in a market with rising property values those value increases will eat up some of the savings in markets where values fall theres got to be one somewhere property owners would get a double bonus paying lower property tax rates on properties with lower values actual mileage may vary school districts are allowed to add back up to four cents to the property tax for local enrichment meaning they dont have to share money raised by that four cents with the state or other districts if your rate now is 150 your first tax cut would be 17 cents and your second would be 33 more cents bringing the total to 1 if your district chooses to grab that fourcent bonus the first one will be 13 cents and the final number would be 104 theres another item here thats on the watch list of the lawyers for the school districts who sued the state to get these changes the system is still set up so that increases in property values result in increases in property tax bills assuming the rates dont change when property values rise that means the local share of school funding rises  not as much state money is needed to fill the cup and if property values go up a lot over several years as they did over the last decade that could throw the school finance system out of balance again and put the whole thing back in court if lawmakers decide to limit increases in taxable property values  through appraisal caps for instance  increases in school costs would be more likely to fall on the state than on the locals wholl have capped values and limits on how fast they can raise rates another way to put it right now increases in property values benefit the state by funding increases in education costs at the local level if the state limits how much money can be raised at the local level it would have to bear the load for increases in school costs dan patrick the houston radio owner and talkshow host who won an expensive and hotly contested republican primary for state senate in march bought a dallas station and will be on the air in the metroplex by september patrick in a press release from his campaign announced hes buying kmgsam based officially in highland park parts of his ksevam show in houston and edd hendees show on that same station will be simulcast in dallas he said with the addition of kmgs we will now have the potential to reach nearly 50 of the people who vote in november elections and close to 60 of the people who vote in republican primaries patrick said in the statement he aims to stir up conservatives in and around dallas county where democrats have made some inroads in local offices that had been solidly republican we look to rejuvenate and mobilize conservatives so they can impact local state and national politics in the metroplex as has been accomplished in houston patrick said hell add some local hosts including representative bill keffer rdallas one of a small group of republican legislators who opposed governor rick perrys successful effort to triple state business taxes to help pay for cuts in local school property taxes patrick isnt a member yet but spoke out against the new business taxes while legislators were debating school finance the texas freedom network in a new report says the distinctions between the religious right and the texas republican party have disappeared the group set out to write about the rise of the religious right and its financial and ideological underpinnings and all of thats in the report called the anatomy of power texas and the religious right in 2006 the report is available free online click here we should say here that tfn is regularly on the other side of the debate from the folks its reporting on and that their report reflects that point of view they contend the doublers are on the verge of getting a majority on the state board of education and level particularly heavy fire on

special session ended in midmay had perry at 41 percent strayhorn at 20 bell at 18 and friedman at 16 the pollsters asked people who theyd vote for if they were standing in the voting booth right now  the margin of error is  41 percent state district judge john dietz  whose ruling against the states school finance system provided the deadline for this years special session  lifted the june 1 deadline dietz had ordered the legislature to fix the unconstitutional system and he was backed by the texas supreme court after lawmakers decided to lower local property taxes  giving some financial breathing room to school districts  lawyers for the state and for the districts that sued went to dietz to lift his injunction officially now thats done karey barton who closed his tax consultancy to

Ready? Set...	2006-04-17	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2006/04/17/ready-set/	en	that act following the easter bunny by a day is none other than your texas legislature coming to austin to work on a problem that has left them bewitched bothered and bewildered for years school finance theyll be watching a 45day egg timer trying to make the school finance system legal by a june 1 deadline imposed by the texas supreme court and they have the luxury of two options for increasing state funding and lowering local funding for schools a burgeoning budget surplus and a new business tax cooked up for governor rick perry that has managed to remain alive in public without attracting the ire of most businesses it looks like most wont attack it and a few of them will even promote it but its hard to raise taxes when theres money in the till  nobody in state office today has had the experience of passing a tax bill except when the state was in some sort of fiscal mess and the surplus  estimated for the moment at 43 billion  might be bigger than that the story starts on monday with this lineup  perry will issue the call  the official agenda  for the legislative session he has said hell try to confine it to school finance shutting out distractions like education reforms appraisal caps and such that ordinarily happens sooner but by holding it back perry prevented lawmakers from prefiling legislation on pet projects and also gave other state leaders less time to look at the exact wording of the call so they could figure out loopholes  comptroller carole keeton strayhorn will issue a new estimate of how much money the state has available for spending the number now is 43 billion and while some state leaders contend the money is earmarked for various projects and contingencies its officially uncommitted and strayhorn is widely expected to say theres even more money available most estimates start at 2 billion though some think theres much more than that she wasnt sprinkling any numbers into the conversation but told a gaggle of reporters that the economy and state tax revenues are doing very very very well well find out monday whether that was foreshadowing or just a head fake  lawmakers will show up call the roll and wait for presentations of the tax bill by former comptroller john sharp appointed by perry to head the texas tax reform commission that cooked up the tax bill other members of that commission will be around to help present the plan the surplus is probably the best clue to whatll happen during the legislative session the perrysharp plan would spend 14 billion of that but would leave the rest in state accounts to be spent elsewhere theyve cautioned against spending more of it house speaker tom craddick lieutenant governor david dewhurst and others like the wonks at the center for public policy priorities have been warning lawmakers that the current surplus isnt really a surplus at all what with the states needs in everything from education to health and human services to younameit theyve made some progress on that front some conservative lawmakers encouraged by the texas public policy foundation would rather attack this without a tax bill representative bill keffer rdallas put it into words recently saying the surplus is really a tax overcharge that ought to be refunded in the form of property tax cuts if strayhorn increases the amount of money available sharp and perry will look like a couple of diet counselors at a fastfood convention even if lawmakers think a tax bill would be a better longterm solution a big surplus will look like the irresistible 1 combo plate at their favorite mexican restaurant theyll be tempted to put that diet on hold until the regular session in january weve written about plans for a media campaign to promote the governors tax bill but the size of the thing is news governor rick perry is gearing up a television radio and direct mail campaign with a proposed budget of 6 million the campaign funded at least in part with corporate money wont be directly linked to perrys reelection campaign but his top political aides are running it and the news prompted a wave of criticism from political opponents and campaign finance reformers perry and former comptroller john sharp  along with a handful of political operatives  made their opening pitch to a group of lobbyists for trade groups this week describing the project and setting the stage for a big fundraising campaign lawmakers will convene next week to consider the tax bill pushed by the governor theyve got a storefront  a 501c6

involved in his campaign effort thats the opening for corporate money and the corporate money is the opening for critics two of perrys gubernatorial opponents chris bell and carole keeton strayhorn said he ought to drop the idea bell initially said the plan was unethical even if it was legal and later aides raised questions about whether the new organizations ties to perry  and its possible lobbying activities  open it up to state disclosure laws strayhorn said perry was violating the spirit of the law and ought to back out of the plan she said shes never raised corporate money for campaigning but ducked questions about a republican party effort in 2002 on behalf of her and other statewide officials that did involve corporate money perry asked how he planned to pay for the promotional effort told reporters to ask kathy  referring to his press secretary kathy walt she said the proponents of the tax bill plan to use the same kind of money the opponents are using the

110 members of the house for reelection at the beginning of the regular session in 2007 craddicks term runs through the end of the year  the house starts its business every two years by electing a

and pete gallego want amendments made available on the internet while theyre being debated on the floor want the house to follow state open meetings laws  the legislature is exempted from many of those statutes want conference committees that reconcile house and senate differences to meet in public and want record votes taken on bills to be available instantly to the public they want to reinstate a rule that required members serving after losing an election to give up chairmanships that would immediately affect representative kent grusendorf rarlington who lost his primary but remains chairman of the house public education committee the democrats want both parties to have the same number of seats on the house general investigating  ethics committee an idea that would move party caucuses into positions of actual power in the house for the first time and theyd prevent the house from adopting special rules on legislation  limiting floor amendments for instance  unless 23rds of the members agree add senator mike jackson rla porte to the list of people interested in the gop position on the ballot in cd22 where us representative tom delay rsugar land plans to retire

deregulation and lower tuition rates if elected those rates jumped significantly when lawmakers left them in the hands of universities the schools complained for years that lawmakers were capping their tuition and shortsheeting them on other funding and when they were set free they began raising costs to compensate bell says that was a bad idea that keeps some texans out of college due to high prices  independent carole keeton strayhorn wants to move the states standardized tests  the taks test given to public school children  from the spring to the fall she says that would make the test

report says ceverha was eligible not a lobbyist when he was appointed to that board that he hasnt violated standards of conduct or done anything that should disqualify him from the board and he recommended no action be taken the board took the report and called it done house democrats accused ceverha of taking the post while he was still a lobbyist and they said he shouldnt have accepted a 100000 gift from houston homebuilder bob perry while on the board that gift in two checks was reported to the texas ethics commission but with no dollar amounts attached after ethics commissioners looked at it and required nothing further ceverha and perry owned up to the amount of the gift in the dallas morning news you can read a backandforth on the ethics commissions decision in the soapbox

legislature once this session is under its belt will have met for 231 days during the 200304 biennium tml says the parttime texas lege met for 255 days compared with 248 days for the fulltime congress  state lawmakers have tried to lower the cap on appraisal increases to limit increases in local taxes local governments have fought it as an infringement of local control right now the limit is 10 percent and an effort to lower it failed in the house last year though itll surely come back the city council in austin offered a new twist they want the state to give them the authority to lower the cap themselves preserving local control and leaving to local voters the question of what ought to be done  the childrens health insurance program is starting a 3 million campaign to sign kids up enrollment has been dropping steadily from 322898 in december of 292681 this month a decline of 93 percent in five months enrollment has dropped by more than 200000 since lawmakers cut it back in 2003

agenda for the special session trs needs about 300 million to balance assets against expected debts and he says itll be easier to fix now than when the problem gets really big hed have the state increase its contribution to 731 percent of educator salaries up from 6 percent and he says the employee retirement system could use a similar though smaller fix an infusion of 60 million in state money george phenix the publisher of texas weekly and the last of the three founders still involved with this enterprise is retiring in 1984 phenix sam kinch jr and john rogers launched the newsletter

Selling Freezers to Eskimos	2006-03-20	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2006/03/20/selling-freezers-to-eskimos/	en	while former comptroller john sharp and the rest of governor rick perrys tax reform commission works on proposed revisions to the states business taxes theyre starting to hear more noise from lawmakers and lobbyists thats not unusual with a special session approaching but its dangerous for tax bills an unprotected tax bill lasts about as long as free pot at a rock concert and isnt nearly as much fun and a couple of republican leaders in the house who were in the middle of the school finance battles of the last year say voting on a tax bill isnt the easiest option available to lawmakers who want to solve the problem with a minimum amount of spilled blood representative warren chisum rpampa sent an email to his colleagues in the house questioning why theyd want to vote on a tax bill while theyve got an estimated 43 billion sitting idle his suggestion take 25 billion or thereabouts and put it into public schools thats enough according to chisum to lower local school property taxes by 20 cents which would temporarily satisfy the courts and would also give school districts freedom to raise a little money for teacher pay or other needs hed allow the districts to raise up to a nickel in local taxes in the first year and up to 15 cents overall if they want to do so and if they win approval from local voters you dont go down and pass a tax bill when youve got a damn surplus  how the hell do you explain that  chisum said during a repair break at his place in pampa which was hit by the range fires in the panhandle chisum said he emailed his idea to everyone in the house  republicans and democrats alike he said he hasnt heard back from most of them but added that he hasnt heard anybody do flipflops over this tax bill  chisum says the presence of a surplus the upcoming elections and the absence of any real leverage to push legislators into an uncomfortable vote all conspire against a tax bill this spring sharp and others have said that spending the surplus now would set the table for a tax bill next year but chisum contends the states economy might make that unnecessary right away representative jim keffer rweatherford says hes still willing to work on a tax bill but says the time constraints will make it difficult and says chisums idea might be attractive to lawmakers were trying to work with the governors office but weve got so many dynamics a lot of lame ducks people coming off of tough primaries people with tough elections in november how do you convince people back home youre doing your job if you pass a tax bill while youve got a surplus thats not very republican  keffer chairman of the taxwriting ways  means committee sidesteps a bit when you ask whether hell be carrying the governors tax proposal he does say its hard to make the case for a tax bill right now but hes quick to say hes not trying to pour cold water on perry or sharp or the tax panel we just have to deal with life as it is and not life as wed like it to be he says a special session on taxes for schools unless its carefully orchestrated could open members to sniping from within and without the house and keffer says the businesses that are in favor of a tax bill wont be nearly as loud as those that are against it that sort of noise can be unnerving in an election year speaking of november he says theres another obstacle and its named carole keeton strayhorn strayhorn is still running for governor and shes still the comptroller and she still controls the numbers  whether the fix is to spend the surplus or pass a tax bill he says we all want to be successful and we all want to make sure the schools open  governor rick perry has said he wants new state income from a revised business tax to replace local school property taxes the legislature has to put more state money into public schools if it wants to keep up education standards while easing pressure on local property taxes the texas supreme court has given the other branches of state government until june 1 to change school finance formulas in a way that gives local schools meaningful control over their own property taxes house speaker tom craddick and lieutenant governor david dewhurst agree  probably by accident  that theyd like to do some education reform and in the past both the house and the senate have tied school finance and education reforms together effectively piggybacking education reform  which isnt required  on school finance reform  which is required by the courts the push by some house leaders to put off school finance reform until the regular session next year could thwart perry whos looking for a big win on school finance in a competitive election year while it also helps craddick and dewhurst get the other goodies they want perry has said his agenda for the special session will be school finance and nothing else his worry is that education reform and other issues could lower chances of a school finance fix or that general horsetrading on side issues would spoil things former comptroller john sharp who heads the perryappointed committee thats trying to cook up a tax bill has said bringing other issues into play would kill a rare chance to overhaul the states primary business tax but in the house where tax bills have to start theres noise about that tax bill and a sentiment among some of craddicks lieutenants to use a multibilliondollar budget surplus to patch school finance until next years regular session that group led for the moment by representative warren chisum rpampa doesnt think voters will sign off on a tax bill when theres money lying around plus putting off the tax bill gets them out of the election season it would also be a boon to legislators who want various sorts of education reform a longterm solution to school finance has to pass and anything attached to it would pass too january might be a better deal for those who want to overhaul school finance and make changes to education even if it makes it harder to pass the tax bill perry and sharp are promoting some businesses like the tax proposal floated but not yet voted on by the governors tax reform commission but some key groups still think the overall tab is too big and squirm at the idea of replacing personal taxes with business taxes in a state that already puts a relatively heavy load on business taxpayers start calling around on the idea and youll stumble across a council on state taxation report that says texas businesses carry 602 percent of the state and local tax burden ernst  young the accounting firm did the numbers for the cst only three states wyoming alaska and south dakota  put greater shares of the tax load on businesses according to that 2005 survey nationally the average business paid 43 percent of the state and local taxes in its locale spin the numbers a different way state and local business taxes in texas equal 58 percent of private sector economic activity no other big state is in that ballpark and the national average was 43 percent former comptroller john sharp has told various groups that the tax reform panel he chairs is trying to raise enough money to replace the current franchise tax and to buy down local school property taxes that would require a business tax that raises around 6 billion along with increased taxes on cigarettes and some smaller items theyre not currently considering a higher sales tax but theyve talked about it and some conservatives prefer it the new deal works for some businesses their property taxes would drop even as average business taxes rose some come out okay some win big and some lose big but the overall burden of state and local taxes would shift away from homeowners  who get a break and no new tax to pay  and toward businesses  which get a break on one tax and a hike in another one the full cost of property tax relief for business and residential property owners would be borne by businesses if youre making plans for april you must be trying to avoid the texas legislature were hearing from two schools of rumor on special sessions at the moment both in april one would have a session starting on april 4 which would put runoff elections and a long easterpassover weekend in the middle of the tax bill were also hearing april 18 which would start the race to june 1 with the first round of elections and the holiday out of the way while were monkeying around with this it would be risky to bet that the tax reform commission will vote out a proposal next week that could still happen but theres some sentiment that waiting until closer to the special session would be smarter that would reduce the amount of time the proposal is exposed to snipers who dont like it take a look at the primary election turnout numbers and you have to conclude that politics is way down on the list of things to worry about for most adults in texas overall turnout was down 225 percent from the gubernatorial primaries four years ago and the drop is completely attributable to democrats they had an expensive and competitive race for governor four years ago this year it was competitive and anemically financed their numbers fell to 600529 this year from 1003388 four years ago a 401 percent bungee jump republican numbers were up 87 percent but their turnout wasnt anything to crow about at 676529 the difference between 2002 and 2006 348753 voters if you want to argue that people who voted four years ago stayed home this time because they want to sign petitions for independent candidates kinky friedman and carole keeton strayhorn youll have to ponder this question which either disproves the idea or points to something interesting ahead were democratic voters the only ones looking for alternatives republicans have a beef with reporters and others who say legislators didnt endorse challengers to incumbents in their own parties before this year the democrats were doing it two years ago they correctly point out its still unusual and it doesnt make for great relationships when the lege convenes this years big example five republicans endorsed chris hatley who lost to representative charlie geren rfort worth in spite of having bottomless financing and campaign help from the texas republican legislative campaign committee and its only real funder dr james leininger of san antonio thats the first time were aware of republicanonrepublican dog piling publicly in a legislative race holler if you have an earlier example its newsy in part because it marks the end of the reagan rule  thou shalt not speak ill of another republican  in texas gop primaries the democrats did something similar this year  with houston incumbents like representative garnet coleman backing opponents of representative al edwards and a group of houston democrats went after representative ron wilson also a democrat from houston two years ago endorsing his opponent alma allen whos now a state representative republicans go after democrats all the time and vice versa but its unusual for republicans to go after their own

called soechtings early out a backroom deal  that in turn elicited an email from dennis teal an sdec member who briefly considered running for the job teals supporting richie who distributed the email and says maxeys pitch misconstrued some of the partys rules and hid maxeys intention of letting richie get the interim job so he wont have as much time to work the floor at the convention fun no

A Dog's Breakfast	2006-03-13	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2006/03/13/a-dogs-breakfast/	en	maybe its a failure of imagination but we dont see an overarching narrative line in the results of this weeks primaries its like sitting with a palm reader who after five minutes of scrutiny looks up and says well this is interesting  when people look back on this one turnout might be the remarkable feature it stunk with some counts still out it appears the republicans attracted 661797 voters or 52 percent of those registered and the democrats attracted 522064 or 41 percent put it this way 9 of 10 registered voters is eligible to sign a petition for kinky friedman or carole keeton strayhorn  nobody in the states congressional delegation got beat us representative henry cuellar dlaredo

incomplete returns managed only 431 percent against his challenger representative carlos uresti diane patrick rarlington beat house public education chairman kent grusendorf in a race seen in austin as a referendum on leadership plans for education truth be told its also a story as is the madla saga about an incumbent going unchallenged for a long time getting careless about his local politics and then getting up too slowly when serious competition finally arrived your previous case study two years ago was house appropriations chairman talmadge heflin rhouston two more incumbents from the dallas area are out though by possibly recountable margins jesse jones ddallas lost to barbara caraway by 68 votes and elvira reyna rmesquite lost to thomas latham by 64 votes  two of the socalled

the us senate race or the race for governor on the gop side lieutenant governor david dewhurst got 78 percent against tom kelly a political unknown and over there the governors race was the biggest vote attractor  in hd38 eddie lucio iii will apparently join his dad in the lege lucio the elder is in the senate the younger won the democratic primary for a house seat  in laredos hd42 richard

group that wont be named until november members who will find out in the general election that they are currently serving their last term in the legislature but theyll be voting and behaving in a special session as if theyre coming back the free agents are the people wholl know during the special session that their days of political risk  and perhaps caution  are behind them even when there arent any notably expensive statewide races state races can be expensive even for losers we took some of the most competitive and expensive battles and charted the costs and the costs per vote one

didnt ask for the comptrollers blessing strayhorn the top vote getter of any gop candidate four years ago is running as an independent against governor rick perry who appointed jones to the rrc strayhorn wouldnt have endorsed jones if shed been asked as it turns out doing so in the view of strayhorns attorneys would have put her independent candidacy at risk like the voters who sign their petitions independent candidates disqualify themselves if they vote in primaries but for the candidates it goes further strayhorns camp interprets the law to say she cant take part in any activities of a political party endorsing their candidates voting in their primaries going to their functions you name it jones did her a favor by not asking for her support us representative tom delay rsugar land closed with an email to supporters telling them to turn out because democrats were seen earlyvoting in gop primaries and phone bank robocalls carried messages from delay himself from fort bend county judge bob hebert from galveston county tax assessorcollector cheryl johnson and from the states top lawyer to wit this is attorney general greg abbott with an important reminder that election

our friend tom delay please vote for him on tuesday   van taylor trying for the republican nomination to challenge us representative chet edwards got a late visit from his friendly neighborhood governor rick perry endorsed taylor over fellow republican tucker anderson in a taped message that taylor stuck on his website at wwwvantaylorcom perry said hes the better candidate to take on edwards in november public squabbling between the republican candidates and between the county chairs of the gop in that district got the incumbents attention edwards campaign emailed news clips to political reporters with the snarkiest parts of the gop dogfight highlighted in bright yellow  democratic gubernatorial candidate chris bell closed the austin part of his primary campaign with a sunday rally featuring an endorsement from senator gonzalo barrientos daustin the two wont serve together even if bell wins barrientos isnt seeking reelection  the loudest of the states senate primaries ended with senator frank madla dsan antonio debating an empty chair on television and with representative carlos urestis campaign advisors filing an ethics complaint against madla the tv debate was set up when uresti said hed joust anytime and anyplace he backed out but the show went on without him and madla got an open forum meanwhile the uresti camp complained to the local da that madlas campaign accounting didnt include all of the money it should have his numbers dont match those filed by texans for lawsuit reform according to the complaints the pac reported giving 655707 while madla reported receiving 36772 madlas camp says its a timing issue and that the numbers will match when the report dates synchronize somebody out on the internet sent a note to urestis campaign that was scribbled on the bottom of an email that appears to have come from helen madla the email urges people to vote on tuesday may 6th  the note scribbled at the bottom you should win your election representative uresti

presser to take his side patrick ended last week with an ethics complaint against grusendorf accusing him of passing out anonymous flyers those handouts were put on tables at a candidate forum and were targeted at those textbook votes by patrick the flyer included pictures of naked men according to the patrick camp grusendorf denied having anything to do with them and suggested the patrick campaign handed them out to generate a sympathetic backlash  martin rogoff one of the gop precinct chairs whose name was on a letter endorsing senate candidate dan patrick pulled his name and said hed be voting for representative joe nixon in that houstonarea contest representative corbin van arsdale sent out an email critical of patrick and his campaign van arsdale said hed been attacked for his support of nixon rogoff said he was joining van arsdale and didnt get a look at the endorsement letter that had his name on it he said he doesnt want to be associated with the tactics of the precinct chairs that are viciously supporting dan  nixons camp meanwhile said patrick listed the support of 117 gop precinct chairs in a recent mailer and adds that 29 of them arent actually precinct chairs patrick got 69 percent in a fourperson field that included him and three elected officials  first lady anita perry opened a getoutthevote email with a sure indication that the people in the governors

doctors at md anderson in houston for more testing diagnosis and treatment aides to carole keeton strayhorn aides say consultant george shipley isnt on the payroll yet but they expect him to be

The Budget Superlatives: The Best and Worst Moments of the ...	2011-04-04	TEXAS OBSERVER	http://www.texasobserver.org/the-budget-superlatives-the-best-and-worst-moments-of-the-budget-debate/	en	after over 22 hours of debate the texas house passed a budget sunday night that looked an awful lot like the first draft offered in january the same drastic cuts to education and health and human services are there college scholarships remain largely zeroed out for incoming freshmen as do grants for prek rate cuts to medicaid providers still stand at almost 33 percent and services for poor and elderly are drastically reduced i know this bill is not perfect said representative jim pitts the appropriations committee chair who largely oversaw the bills drafting and carried the bill on the floor i believe it can be improved further and i believe it will be  but that improvement will have to happen in the senate or in the conference committee in which the two chambers reconcile their different versions of the budget the house is done for now their version will appeal to the fiscal hardlinethere are no new taxes or other forms of revenue the chamber willl have to approve fee increases individually with such drastic cuts the budget has some scary political implications for politicians who fear returning home to districts with schools and hospitals closing many house reps are counting on the senate to find more money so that the drastic cuts arent all implemented but that didnt stop the budget from passing along largely partyline votes only two republicans representatives david simpson and aaron pea voted against the bill in the first floor vote of course this being the texas legislature there was no shortage of bizarre and exciting moments on the floor so for those of you watching basketball or otherwise enjoying your weekend instead of sitting in the capitolheres what you missed most interesting representative representative david simpson early on in the budget debate it was clear representative david simpson wasnt going to play by the usual partisan rules the tea party freshman from longview upset his own republican colleagues early in the debate when he offered an amendment to defund the commission for the arts in favor of nursing facilities in the department of aging and disabilities its the right thing to do simpson said in his quiet manner neither party seemed to know exactly what to dothe commission for the arts has some powerful political supporters but voting against nursing facilities doesnt exactly look great democrats complained that the bill was offering a false choice while some republicans were suspicious that the amendment was an effort to hurt moderates in fact fellow goper vicki truitt surmised that simpson could be setting up a record vote that can be used against us in primaries  but simpson found a staunch ally in veteran democrat representative pete gallego who urged members to at least do what mr simpson does and help the elderly lets do some things that make sense  in the end his measure passed in a nonparty line vote of 67 to 61 with 17 democrats registering present not voting  but simpson wasnt done he had another amendment to shift money away from the governors film incentives program and into grants for small and rural libraries when a similar measure from democrat rafael anchia failed anchia tried to help simpson with his measure simpson withdrew the measure temporarily to confirm that his numbers were accurate and that the bill couldnt be killed by a point of order he even called the state comptroller on saturday it didnt matter though i had assurances from people very high up in this state that it did not cost the bill and i was told at the very last minute that it did simpson told me they made a decision in a private room without me  that killed simpsons support for the budgetand the tea party representative voted against the bill he said he decided against it when he saw half billion dollars going to corporate welfare instead of the weak among us  in particular he wanted to see funding decreased for corporate incentives like the film incentives and the governors enterprise fund in favor of schools and health care we need to cut spending we need to live within our means simpson told me after it was all over looking absolutely despondent but we should have started with corporate welfare and not with community colleges not with the nursing homes that is what is so disappointing to me  most likely to be on the daily show wayne christian   it was as one reporter said a career move  in quick succession representative wayne christian rcenter offered up two education amendments so antiintellectual that they managed to raise eyebrows for the record thats no easy feat in this particular electoral body his first amendment required universities to offer family and traditional values centers if they also offered centers for lgbt students well not just lgbtto cover his bases christians amendment offered a laundry list of sexual identities including homosexual bisexual pansexual transsexual transgender gender questioning  that was too much for representative joaquin castro dsan antonio who got up with a bit of a grin to ask christian just what  exactly is a pansexual  christian looking a bit uncomfortable didnt offer a technical definitionbut he did apologize to all the ladies in the auditorium  but few in the house were willing to vote against traditional values and the bill passed by a vote of 110 to 24 ten democrats wouldnt take a stand on the issue at all and simply registered present not voting  but while homophobia didnt seem to raise much ire christians next amendment managed to make the vast majority of the house uncomfortable it required universities to ensure that at least 10 percent of their classes be on western civilization as democrats rose to ask just what western civ would include it soon became clear christian wasnt sweating the details rather he was just worried that most children think that freedom started at the time of the civil rights movement  this would require they learn history but what history democrats asked native american mexican american african would white european history be included in african history  shot back a tonguetied christian borris miles simply shook his head lets pull this down brother he told christian and with that 108 members of the house voted against the amendment best line representative harold dutton i thought that would leave them with one guy and one phone because i thought thats all they needed  representative harold dutton dhouston on his ideal version of the texas education agency dutton had an amendment to defund the texas education agency and send the savings to school districts republican representative burt solomons had already offered a similar point i think you need to start over with the tea solomons had argued i mean from scratch  both measures failed bitterest fight family planning it was the moment at which the democratic minorityless than a third of the housefelt their irrelevance most house republicans introduced amendment after amendment all stripping money away from the programs democratic arguments didnt matter in the end less than 40 percent of the program funding remainedbarely enough to get federal matching dollars family planning programs offer contraceptives and womens health screening and by law cannot offer abortions the gop amendments took money from those programs and put it into services for autistic children or mentally ill children and the like many democrats faced with choosing between two priorities opted to register present not voting rather than choosing a side in one weird and early exchange democratic representative mike villarreal dsan antonio attacked an amendment by representative randy weber rpearland to take 8 million out of the program based on a foreign study weber argued that women who use contraception are more likely to have abortions you think contraception doesnt work  asked the democrat have you ever used contraception yourself  weber was dismissive i dont think i know you well enough to go down this road he said tersely after all he knew his amendment like all the amendments stripping family planning funds would pass on partyline votes most moving lament after hours of milling around and having side conversations as debate raged the entire house sat quietly to hear speeches against the budget the mood respectful and quiet seemed to heighten the gravitas as appropriations vicechair sylvester turner dhouston took the floor he was the last of eight democrats to speak against the bill and he didnt hold back he thanked appropriations chair jim pitts and repeatedly invoked his respect for the appropriations committee but its bigger than that turner said it is much much bigger than that  as turner outlined his fears about a budget that could cause 80 percent of nursing homes to close he turned on those who promised it would get better once the senate has a crack this is the peoples house turner said we dont wait on the senate to save us we dont wait on the senate to give us cover it reflects the house values  his voice echoed across the chamber after a long day turner seemed to get the houses attention as he spoke not one of us will leave this chamber and go back to our district and take ownership of those cuts he said what about our children what about our teachers and what about the elderly  he invoked his own familywhere thanks to education he and his siblings could pay for his elderly and ailing mothers health care his voice began to crack with emotion i wont vote for you and neither should you he implored his colleagues if this is the texas house then the texas house needs to stand up it hurts too many when it should not  and a few minutes later the house passed the budget
Political Intelligence - The Texas Observer	2006-04-21	TEXAS OBSERVER	http://www.texasobserver.org/2188-political-intelligence-marchers-mccain-y-mas/	en	universities and institutions of higher learning are supposed to promote intelligence but the university of texaspan american in edinburg might be taking that mission a bit too literally the university may soon offer classes sponsored by the central intelligence agency and other federal intelligence agencies thats right utpa students may soon get a degree in the cia long a recruiting center for the clandestine agency utpa is floating a plan to join four other universities in the country that house an intelligence community center of academic excellencea 1 million academic program run by the 15 federal agencies that comprise the us intelligence community the goal of the centers is to increase the pool of eligible applicants in core skills areas specifically targeting women and racialethnic minorities according to the federal governments guidelines while utpa has not yet submitted a proposal to the department of defense the word around campus is that students accepted into the programwhich requires a 30 gpa and us citizenshipwill enroll in classes with special curricula developed by university faculty in consultation with the intelligence community for example trinity university in washington dc home to one of the four existing intelligence centers offers a history course entitled east vs west just war jihad and crusade 1050  1450 that according to the syllabus seeks to develop the criticalanalytical and writing skills that are particularly important to the intelligence community  graduates of the program will receive a minor degree in national security studies and the chance to work for the cia and other agencies the center also will sponsor a summer camp for high school students they call it spy camp at trinityno were not making that up the center at utpa will also fund new faculty positions travel to other countries andcrypticallyother related activities perhaps a stab at a coup detat in venezuela or iran some faculty and students arent thrilled about their schools new academic program they are profiling certain universities that have a high minority enrollment said josi mata a 40yearold utpa student of anthropology they want students to fit in in third world countries specifically latin america  mata points to the longrunning presence of the cia the fbi the military and defense companies at utpa besides frequent recruiting sessions on campus both the fbi and the cia have paid edventure partners a californiabased company to work with utpa business students enrolled in a marketing class to develop an educational program that presents the agencies in a positive light and encourages recruitment of other students samuel freeman a professor of political science at utpa added i think the center can conceivably have a chilling effect on academic freedom  but dr van reidhead the dean of the department of behavorial and social sciences where the center would be housed insists that the university wouldnt put in place a program that had any kind of manipulation on the part of the intelligence community  reidhead promotes the center as a benevolent winwin for the cashstarved university which will receive much needed federal dollars and for an intelligence community in desperate need of criticalthinking skills in the aftermath of the botched job on saddam husseins nonexistent wmds still not everyones convinced as samantha garcia a biology major from corpus christi put it you just cannot have a government agency inside the classroomits indoctrination  fear not sexy cheerleadersyou can now shake and shimmy in those dance routines all you want thats because 13term incumbent state representative al edwards dhoustonthe author of last sessions infamous antisexycheerleading billwas bounced from office in the primary runoff election on april 11 edwards loss was one of several runoff election results that may further erode speaker tom craddicks power edwards is one   of craddicks   closest democratic   allies in the house the speaker rewarded   edwards with a   spot on the house   appropriations   committee and chairmanship   of the house rules   and resolutions   committee last   session edwards   was also the lone   democrat to vote   in favor of a controversial   gopbacked propertytaxcut   bill democratic   challenger borris   miles a former   law enforcement   officer who now   sells insurance   ousted edwards   with 535 percent   of the voteand   with support from   some of edwards   democratic house   colleagues in   a way though   edwards isnt   going anywhere a likeness of him   is set to adorn   the planned juneteenth   monument edwards   serves as chairman   in perpetuity of   the statefunded   juneteenth commission   that created the   monument the other house incumbent who went down in the runoff was scott campbell rsan angelo campbell lost his seat despite a recent 10000 contribution from the future of texas pacone of the pacs funded by james leininger the san antonio multimillionaire school voucher proponent and craddick backer campbell was desperate after nearly losing outright in the march 7 primary and didnt exactly take the high road in the runoff campbell put out mailers and radio spots that accused challenger drew darby of failing to pay child support and claimed that darby abandoned his family after his first marriage ended ten days before the runoff darby filed a libel suit against campbell darbys win was another success for the texas parent pac the group of mostly parent teacher association moms who dived into the gop primary to challenge members of craddicks leadership team over education policy see wrath of the soccer moms march 24 2006 in the runoff three of the four republican candidates backed by parent pac won their elections including darby including the march 7 primary eight of the 15 house candidates backed by parent pac won the gop nominationnot bad for a first election s se puede earlier this month another wave of massive rallies for immigrant rights took place across the state and throughout the nationevidence of a new civil rights movement on april 9 500000 marched in dallasa city not exactly known for protest marches on april 10 the anniversary of the death of mexican revolutionary hero emiliano zapata hundreds of thousands marched around the nation in over 100 cities including 500000 in washington dc 125000 in phoenix and smaller protests everywhere from heartland locales such as boise idaho and des moines iowa to waco texas where an estimated 3500 people took to the streets driving all those marches was a bill passed by the us house of representatives late last year that would criminalize illegal immigrants juan ortega an undocumented immigrant from honduras who is helping to build an austin bank took time off from work to join an estimated 10000 to 12000 people at the capitol waving flagsamerican mexican honduran salvadoran and cubanand listening to speeches in english and spanish we are here to work nothing more said ortega dressed in a cowboy hat and dustspattered jeans we are not criminals just people who do the hard work  against the backdrop of thousands chanting s se puede yes we can and aqu estamos y no nos vamos here we are and we wont go ortega said that he fears that he and 12 million other illegal immigrants will soon be branded criminals and sent home for an austin high school student who introduced himself to a youthful crowd at utaustin as ruiz orozco there was an additional motivation to march we need to show we can not only do the hard jobs he said an immigrant from mexico ruiz orozco was one of hundreds of middle and highschool students from the austin area who left class to join the rally and march risking fines and suspension we can do the good jobs because we are good enough to do it  a sign behind him echoed his call my father was an undocumented worker im a law studentlet us all live the dream  messages such as these are seeking an audience in dc as the senate tears through draft after draft of an immigration reform bill a bipartisan effort to pass a compromise bill in the senate was announced with great fanfare on april 7 but fell apart later that day according to cecilia muoz of the national council of la raza in washington dc there was overwhelming support for the compromise bill which would have legalized some roughly 10 million people while another group would have been able to adjust their status with additional hurdles in two to five years we have been urging both sides of the aisle to get to an agreement  and to protect it throughout the legislative process  congress is expected to take up the immigration issue again when it reconvenes on april 24 expect more protests senator john mccain has some work to do before he can run for president mccains problem is that too many rightwingers the grassroots voters so important in the gop presidential primary see the arizona republican as being too liberal in response mccain has taken to the roadincluding a recent stop in texasto prove his conservatism in an april 3 speech at the george hw bush presidential library foundation at texas am university mccain sucked up to 41 and wowed the crowd of students and older people with decidedly conservative rhetoric and praise for the former president his wife and their son mccain has at times put forth somewhat conservationist stances on environmental issues in his am speech however he went so far as to support president george w bushs 2001 decision to opt out of the kyoto protocol an agreement under which industrialized countries agreed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases mccain told the crowd at rudder auditorium on the college station campus that he opposed the kyoto accord because it exempted india and china ok so mccain gave a technicalalbeit lamejustification for the kyoto pullout but he has an even harder time explaining some other recent moves to appease the countrys influential rightwing voters for example mccain has announced his support for extending the bush tax cuts that he fiercely opposed when they were passed in his most extreme effort to shed  his moderate image mccain has agreed to speak at an institution of higher learning that makes am look like a liberal thinktank in may he plans to deliver the commencement address at of all places jerry falwells liberty university mccain once described falwell as an agent of intolerance  that should send the desiredmessage to the hyperconservative republicans across the country that mccain is no moderate

generally a bad idea to walk around drunk or brandish a gun in public or kiss other peoples wives borris miles a firstterm democratic state rep from houston managed to do all three in the same night miles transgressions at a nowinfamous holiday party in december contributed to a blowout loss on march 4 in his primary race against former state al edwards with no gop opponent edwards will return to the legislature where he served more than 20 years before losing to miles in 2006 in his previous stint edwards backed republican house speaker tom craddick he may well again if his campaign finance filings are any indication more than 75 percent of the 82000 edwards raised for his race came from wellknown republican donors that includes 35000 from houston homebuilder and craddick backer bob perry who bankrolled the swift boat attacks that helped sink john kerry perhaps the most disconcerting aspect of representative aaron peas second victory over challenger eddie saenz in the democratic primary in edinburg was his claim to underdog status pea is chairman of the criminal jurisprudence committee and a stalwart of republican speaker tom craddick a socalled craddick d  pea raised 424305 for the 2008 cycle according to campaign watchdog texans for public justice this princely sum included 106000 from the largest republican donor in the state bob perry yet pea declared that his winning margin just shy of a thousand votes was a victory over a well entrenched heavily financed boss and patronage system  since saenz lost to pea in both 2004 and 2008 it seems like the system isnt entrenched like it used to beor maybe it is republican representative phil king  is a selfprofessed christian but jesus doesnt win electionsmammon does king crushed his primary opponent public school advocate and former weatherford mayor joe tison with a little help from his friends the corporations he oversees as chairman of the house regulated industries committee energy and telecom interests not to mention governor rick perry and a craddickbacked pac poured huge sums of money into kings campaign coffers in the months before the election rather than turn water into wine king turned cash over 660000 since july 2007 into attack ads painting tison as a closet democrat tison pulled in almost 164000 including sizable contributions from texas parent pac a parentrun organization that promotes proeducation candidates the loss of the moderates and independents tison needed to the democratic presidential primary probably didnt help him either facing his first significant challenge in years representative ismael kino flores beat back opponent sandra rodriguez in the democratic primary in mission kino parlayed the power of incumbency read money and his support for republican speaker tom craddick read money into a 900vote victory the representative has reported raising 625670 in the 2008 cycle almost twice as much as rodriguezs total his contribution list reads like a whos who of lobbyists and republican donors including 11000 from lobby powerhouse hillco partners and 51000 from houston homebuilder bob perry despite his chairmanship of the licensing and administrative procedures committee which oversees gaming in the state flores also accepted 4000 from the littlefield corp which runs bingo games maybe dr james leininger should just stay out of the hill country since 2006 the republican campaign contributor known in some quarters as gods sugar daddy has dumped well over half a million dollars into republican primaries in house district 73 which stretches from fredericksburg to san antonio bedroom communities like schertz in 2006 leininger protg nathan macias raised a total of 552522 to unseat carter casteel leininger provided about 84 percent of macias money the incumbent did not support the doctors pet cause public school vouchers casteel lost in a squeaker to macias who supports vouchers despite efforts by ally speaker tom craddick leiningers 2007 voucher proposal failed again in the lege even macias didnt vote for it he abstained it now looks like that will be macias only opportunity despite an infusion of at least 74221 from leininger and almost 30000 more from a leiningerfunded political action committee macias lost to challenger doug miller by 38 votes macias has asked for a recount if hillary clinton threw the kitchen sink at barack obama recently in their relatively tame presidential primary thencontinuing the analogywhat major appliance did dr tom annunziator hurl at restaurateur  and state representative charlie geren a fullsized washer a walkin freezer their republican primary to determine who represents north fort worth in the texas house devolved into a shout fest with both candidates calling the other a liar one annunziato mailer even claimed geren put more drunk drivers behind the wheel  no matter gerena republican moderate and vocal critic of house speaker tom craddickwon a fifth term in the legislature annunziato an optometrist poured more than 400000 into the race a lot of that money came from craddick allies including the group texans for fiscal responsibility and san antonio millionaire james leininger who chipped in 75000 even with all the help annunziato lost by 17 points maybe he should stick to eye exams seventerm democratic incumbent representative dawnna dukes

republican district the gop primary campaign cost nearly threequarters of a million dollars and featured candidates who courted conservatives and hurled insults haggerty characterized margo as a carpetbagger who only recently moved into a wellappointed apartment in the district margo summed up his opponent as too liberal and too friendly with lobbyists the texas house is going to miss the hardpartying haggerty judging from the numerous campaign contributions from legislators and beer distributors after all it was haggerty who at the 11th hour led the suicidal charge against speaker tom craddicks hamfisted leadership of the house margo will next face democrat and el paso county assistant district attorney joe moody in the general election democrats who voted for haggerty in the past expect the district to swing back to the democratic fold armando walle defeated incumbent representative kevin bailey in the democratic primary because of turnout not dollars the 30yearold walle is a product of district 140 in northeastern harris county until march 4 it was consistently one of the lowestturnout districts in the state in the democratic primary in 2006 only 1295 people cast ballots this cycle  bailey called in support from speaker tom craddick which garnered a 50000 check from craddicks texas jobs pac and 25000 from gopallied texans for lawsuit reform it wasnt enough a strong

houstonarea republicans dont cross the senator from talk radio firstterm gop state senator dan patrick used his talk show to engineer the narrow defeat of fellow republican representativecorbin van

congresswoman shelley sekula gibbs notorious for driving off delays staff during her sevenweek term in 2006 sekula gibbs will face pete olson in an april 8 runoff for the chance to challenge the incumbent democrat nick lampson sekula gibbs is painting olson who staffed for phil gramm and john cornyn for nine years as a washington insider which is what they call you when you can get a job in washington she also claims to be the true conservative olson is pointing to his national security experience he was in the navy for nine years and noting that sekula gibbs a dermatologist has none hes also calling sekula gibbs support of daylabor sites a vote for illegal immigrants sekula gibbs changed her vote when somebody informed her that illegal immigrants used the sites according to a gop source quoted in the dc paper the hill the republican establishment is firmly behind olson because sekula gibbs left a bitter taste in a lot of peoples mouths with her bizarre and erratic behavior and the texas delegation realizes that she is not a viable option in the general election  still sekula gibbs has name recognition the most money and significant community support in fact the pastor of a 12000member megachurch in houston offered sekula gibbs so much support that americans united for the separation of church and state called for an irs investigation pastor steve riggle wrote an endorsement letter for the sekula gibbs campaign on his personal stationery which identified him as the pastor of grace community church riggle urged a vote for sekula gibbs because she is the only candidate who will cosponsor legislation to give people of faith their voices back by letting them among other things legally endorse political candidates in the seven months since uranium energy corp applied to the texas commission on environmental quality for a permit to mine uranium in goliad county citizens and officials there have expressed their collective opposition through press conferences letters to public officials and wellattended public meetings now theyre pursuing legal action goliad county has notified uec that the county intends to sue the austinbased company for violating the federal safe drinking water act the county plans to file a separate lawsuit in federal court to force uec to halt uranium exploration in the county and repair any damage to the local aquifer created by exploratory drilling since it began in may 2006 uec officials responded with a statement any lawsuit filed regarding uranium energy corp s exploration activities is completely without merit and will be vigorously defended by the company the state agency with direct responsibility for the administration of the safe drinking water act has already thoroughly investigated the countys complaint and continues to actively fulfill its charge of ensuring the protection of the environment  in late march the state agency with direct responsibility the texas railroad commission  investigated th  companys drilling and found it in violation of state regulations for not adequately plugging some 74 exploratory holes the company responded by properly filling the holes in recent securities and exchange commission filings it boasted that as late as november 2007 the railroad commission praised uec for its prompt attention to restoring the drilling sites but in its notice of intent to sue goliad county officials claim to have found additional unplugged exploratory holes as recently as early february they allege that the improperly covered holes have already contaminated a portion of the evangeline aquifer which runs beneath the county further the lawsuit will allege that uec either intentionally or through gross negligence polluted the aquifer to facilitate its application for a uraniummining permit which is still under review by the tceq according to the notice to obtain the type of permit uec is seeking the company is required by the safe drinking water act to prove that the aquifer in the location of the proposed mine is unsuitable for drinking the county claims that the company did not take initial samples of the aquifer until december 2006roughly seven months after the company says it began drilling and some three months before the railroad commission cited the company for improperly plugging holes the lag time between drilling and baseline water testing the county alleges was designed to allow the aquifers water to degrade so that it would be deemed undrinkable and thus no hindrance to mining

gop representative says his true opponent in the election for district 78 is house speaker tom craddick a fellow republican its going to be a tough race we are talking unlimited money says the gravelvoiced haggerty of his republican opponent dee margo you may remember margo a wealthy el paso businessman who ran unsuccessfully against state senator eliot shapleigh in a highdollar campaign in 2006 now hes decided he wants to be a representative haggerty scoffs he sees craddick behind margos candidacy a spokesperson for the speaker dismisses the idea but craddick who is known to hold a grudge has plenty of reasons to want revenge last year haggerty was the chief protagonist in a walkout during the legislative session to protest craddicks ironfisted leadership style he has also filed for speaker in a bid to unseat craddick whose rule haggerty characterizes as tyrannical  last election cycle margo spared no expense during his senate campaign fielding donations from heavyhitter donors such as houston multimillionaire bob perry first lady laura bush even jetted in for a day to help with fundraising will she do the same for a mere house seat most recently haggerty is questioning margos residency in district   78 back in october while still a resident of district 77 margo told the el   paso times that he wanted to build a singlestory home in haggertys   district because the familys longtime housekeeper is crippled   and it would be easier for her to get around in a onelevel home than in the   margos current threelevel home  to run in the march primary margo needed to be in the house by november 4   to meet the states oneyear residency requirement for the general election haggerty says margo hasnt shown that he relocated in time margo counters   in news

representative from houstonwho gained national notoriety in 2005 for proposing a bill banning sexy cheerleading routinesis running for his old seat in the texas house edwards is challenging representative borris miles in the district 146 democratic primary its a rematch of their 2006 race that miles won in a runoff ending edwards 27year tenure in the legislature in that campaign miles labeled edwards a sellout for his enthusiastic support of the speaker midland republican tom craddick edwards legislative career may have peaked in his first session in 1979 when he authored the bill that created the juneteenth holiday hes spent the past quartercentury reminding everyone about it the web site of edwards juneteenth usa nonprofit proclaims the holiday is thanks to texas state representative al edwards  he was named chairman in perpetuity of the texas emancipation juneteenth cultural and historical commission thats the tejchc a state agency created in 1998 through a bill authored by youknowwho the commission is charged with building the recently finished juneteenth memorial which contains a statue of a lawmaker figure with a face that happens to resemble a certain former state rep from houston his face may be etched in stone but it was the sexycheerleading bill two   sessions ago that made edwards nationally famous the bill didnt pass   but the resulting fiasco provided several horrifying moments weve tried   hard to forget including edwards embarrassing turn on comedy centrals   the daily show he didnt know it was a fake news   program we also have the cheerleading bill to thank for introducing the phrase   droppin it low into the lexicon of texas politics why would edwards come back not for those sexy cheerleaders apparently this time edwards is aiming a tad higher the press release announcing his candidacy reads i want to help save and preserve texas state university texas history more importantly emancipation juneteenth and all of texas culture sic miles is not without scandal himself the houston chronicle reported   in midjanuary that the firstterm rep recently crashed a party thrown by a   rival insurance salesman in houston miles reportedly burst in carrying a bottle   of wine and a glass he told his nemesis that the town wasnt big enough   for the two of them and to get out of the insurance business according to   an eyewitness miles then said he was a thug and a gangster   and brandished a gun in front of his rival before kissing the mans wife were thinking hes watched scarface one too many times chuck rosenthal the harris county district attorneyhimself embroiled   in a scandal involving relations with his secretary and the use of his office   for electioneeringis investigating the incident miles didnt return   calls for comment from the observer the first thing you might notice about representative phil king is that hes the spittin image of simpsons character ned flanders like flanders he is pious as hell yet this republican from weatherford has none of the cartoon characters compassion neighborliness or goofy humor instead he exhibits a steely devotion to a corporate agenda unbent by shifting local concerns king a hardline conservative and craddick lieutenant from weatherford has for the first time drawn a formidable opponent in the gop primary joe tison a longtime educator and former weatherford mayor is blasting king for being too cozy with industry and betraying the districts public schools in keeping with this years political theme of change tison argues that king has become too entrenched in the austin power structure and has grown distant from the districts needs installed by craddick in 2003 as the chair of the regulated industries committee king shepherded legislation deregulating the cable television industry  a boon for att  and played defense for utilities worried about a consumer outcry over high electric rates when you spend all your time working with the telecommunications and electric industry  my question is why dont you use that power to help the people back home who elected you  tison said a good question but perhaps this is the answer in january the president of att circulated a memo to employees and retirees asking them to hit the street in support of kings reelection effort tison is backed by texas parent pac a group of concerned parents in favor of public education with a string of electoral successes against incumbents with voting records at odds with the groups values phil king is not known for being responsive to the needs of his local public schools said parent pac head carolyn boyle hes not been an advocate hes not been an active listener for people like parents and elected school board members  kings animosity toward public education recently surfaced when he floated the discredited idea of funding schools with sales taxes instead of property taxes tison has attacked this plan as a middleclass tax hike that would give austin unprecedented control over local school districts king is expected to greatly outspend tison in this deepred district west of ft worth the most recent campaign finance filings show that king has over 286000 onhand in a sign that king takes tison seriously some of that war chest is already financing push polls that ask voters leading questions about tisons alleged record as a taxandspend mayor who oversaw a rise in crime the winner of the republican primary will face chuck randolph a democrat from decatur in the general election austins cheap hotels technological savvy and bevy of liberal volunteers were enough to attract the organizers of the third annual netroots nation convention to the city the convention which will offer panels presentations and film screenings focused on using the internet and web logs as vehicles for progressive thought and collaboration will be held at the austin convention center july 1720 netroots nation formerly known as the yearlykos convention evolved from   the liberal blog dailykos in 2006 organizers decided to change the name this   year to more accurately reflect the makeup of its audience according   to the events web site in an email to the observer markos   moulitsas the founder of dailykos explained his take on the name change i   was never affiliated with yearlykos i licensed out the name since the organizers   emerged from the daily kos community but it was never my project no matter   how many people wanted to give me credit for it in fact i was one of the people   who pushed yearlykos hardest to change their name  so netroots nation   was born participants in netroots nation dont have many distinguishing characteristics   in common besides their liberal views and love for the internet bloggers activists   and politicians from all states and age groups flock to the event with one common   goal according to the washington post attendees are mostly   interested in getting democrats electedand making sure democrats stay   in power  moulitsas is looking forward to the convention especially since he no longer bears the weight of having his name plastered all over it  as an attendee he told us i can focus

filing deadline for the 2012 primaries that has now been pushed back to monday with the likelihood of another window after we get some kind of ruling about what the maps will look like but a flock of hopefuls acted like yesterday was the drop dead day anyway here taken from an email carl whitmarsh sent out with all of the democratic filings so far is a sample of local races of interest united states senator  daniel boone sean hubbard  anybody have any idea where gen ricardo sanchez is even with the delayed deadline youd think someone would have heard something by now united states representative district 7  phillip andrews jim cargas  see stace for info about cargas 2010 write in candidate lissa squiers has been collecting petition signatures for this race but i have no idea where she is with that seems like a dicey year to be collecting sigs as no one knows which ones will be ultimately valid united states representative district 10  dan grant  see bor for the official announcement united states representative district 22  kesha rogers doug blatt  rogers is the larouchie candidate who won the nomination in 2010 lets not make that mistake again shall we a third candidate kp george of fort bend has also filed but since he did so in fbc hes not in this report state board of education district 6  patricia q nilsson traci jensen david scottstate board of education district 7  dexter smith  and to think i had been worried about getting one candidate for this race whoever wins will not be facing incumbent terri leo as she has reportedly decided to step down according to ross ramsey district 7 is david bradleys and im glad to see someone file against him even if i know nothing about him house district 131  alma allen i wanda adams  we now have three current council members looking for office elsewhere the first was mike sullivan who is running against tax assessor don sumners for the gop nomination the thirdwell get to that in a minute adams defeated lawrence allen the sboe member in district 4 who won the seat after allen knocked off ron wilson in the 2004 primary in a runoff in 2007 for council district d so this is sort of a rematch by proxy and its not the only one but once again im getting ahead of myself house district 134  ann johnson  i am aware of at least two other people who were looking at this race but as of the deadlinethatwasnt the field still belongs to ann johnson house district 137  jamaal smith joseph carlos madden  both smith and madden announced their intent to run shortly after representative scott hochberg bowed out brandon dudley a 2010 judicial candidate and chief of staff to state senator rodney ellis has also expressed interest in this seat house district 144  kevin j risner ornaldo ybarra mary ann perez  perez is the hcc trustee in district iii who knocked off incumbent diane guzman by a razorthin 44 vote margin in 2009 risner and ybarra had filed earlier there was yet another person announcing himself as a potential candidate at that time but i have not heard anything further from him since then house district 146  borris miles i al edwardshouse district 147  garnet coleman i ray hill  yes this is now four consecutive elections featuring miles v edwards all i can say is that i hope the pattern is broken this time if youre wondering why ray hill is running against representative coleman see here for the reason i respect ray hill but representative coleman has my full support civil district court 215  steve kirkland i elaine h palmer  judge kirkland is the only sitting democratic jurist to draw a challenge so far hes also the only openly gay member of the bench i have no idea if these two facts are related or not county school board trustee position 6 precinct 1  erica s lee jarvis johnson  and here we have our third council member seeking another office as well as our second parentchild rematch johnson unsuccessfully challenged erica lees mother representative sheila jackson lee in the 2010 primary for cd18 and like that one this one is on my ballot as well meanwhile over in precinct 3 2010 candidate for hd132 silvia mintz has announced her candidacy for that precincts hcde seat county commissioner precinct 3  a robert hassan glorice mcpherson  hassan ran for the democratic nomination for county judge in 2010 against gordon quan and in 2008 against david mincberg and ran as a republican for cd18 in 2006 i know nothing about glorice mcpherson constable precinct 1  jack abercia i cindy varaleija quincy whitaker alan rosen grady castleberryconstable precinct 2  zerick guinn lee hernandez christopher diaz joe martinez jeffrey freeman harry zamora ruben loreto daniel vela danny avalosconstable precinct 3  ken jones i eric reedkenneth perkinsconstable precinct 6  victor trevino iconstable precinct 7  may walker i samuel hayes jr michael coleman leon hubbard  i have no idea why constable is such a popular office i do know that constables abercia and walker are having some troubles so maybe thats part of it then again so is constable trevino and hes the only one unopposed so who knows harris county democratic party chair  lane lewis  last but certainly not least another race in which there have been rumors of other candidates but no other filings as yet one person sent out an email announcing his intent to run then sent another saying hed changed his mind a second has a draft movement going on prior to either of these there was some unknown entity sending out emails to lewis on which a bunch of others were bcced asking a bunch of obnoxious questions the originating addresses were bogus and they had the feel of groundwork for a challenge to lewis but so far that has not materialized well see what happens at the cec meeting on the 20th monday is the official filing deadline until and unless one or more court decrees otherwise expect another late flurry of filings at that time

contract being negotiated with a consultant who took an expensespaid business trip to costa rica with trustee larry marshall the deal involves local businessman and medical doctor kenneth wells who traveled with marshall and a state lawmaker last november to explore cheaper health care in central america marshall introduced wells to superintendent terry grier and the districts chief financial officer two months after the trip newly obtained records show wells would charge the cashstrapped district 600 to 650 an hour based on early negotiations although his specific responsibilities were not detailed before the school board vote authorizing the deal in june the districts benefits manager repeatedly tried to get details from wells including how his services differed from hisds other health care consultant according to emails released in response to an open records request it did raise a question i can tell you that robert moore hisds inspector general said tuesday declining to elaborate that matter is still under review by the district  longtime acquaintance a contract with wells and his company alken health resources has not been finalized but the board approved a limit of 640000 the districts chief financial officer melinda garrett said tuesday she expected the deal to total less than half that amount marshall said he knew wells for years before traveling to costa rica twice last year in trips arranged by state representative borris miles dhouston and his business partner dicarlos davis they said the costa rica n government paid the bill wells specializes in medical tourism  the growing trend of traveling for cheaper health care  and gave a presentation on the topic at the costa rica conference that marshall attended he has quite a reputation with exemplary credentials marshall said of wells i had discussions with him in terms of my hopes and my dreams for the houston independent school district  wells said in an email that he could not respond to questions tuesday because he was out of town at a conference garrett touted wells credentials  he has done work for several major oil and gas companies  and said that as a doctor he would bring a different perspective from the districts other consultant mercer which helps to manage the benefits program the district paid mercer 48 million last year despite the vague documents sent to the school board about wells garrett said he would be given specific tasks such as lowering costs for the districts most chronically ill employees and reviewing changes to the workers compensation program she said wells would not focus on medical tourism because the district now has other priorities the district did not have to competitively bid the deal garrett said because state law allows for exclusive contracts for professional services including doctors if this item would come up tomorrow i would still recommend it she said we think to have someone come in and try to help us minimize our costs is the right thing to do  unanswered emails  brad bailey hisds general manager of benefits emailed wells two days before the school board voted on his deal repeating a request to detail specific tasks bailey also asked wells if he had any connection to the costa rica trip which had been mentioned in a houston chronicle article wells did not respond to the questions according to emails and interviews from my perspective we still do not have a good definition around the first year goals for his services bailey wrote garrett a few days before the board meeting bailey said in an interview that his job is to ask difficult questions and he has had similar pressing discussions with other vendors grier said he wasnt involved with the details in the wells proposal but recalled meeting the consultant briefly at a meeting with marshall and garrett in january grier also signed off on a nocost contract with wells in march for a preliminary review of the districts benefits program records show we are not planning to write a blank check to this man for 650000 and then say heres what we want  grier pledged tuesday frances fowler the chairwoman of the american association of healthcare consultants estimated the typical hourly fee for a medical adviser at 450 to 500 but said the rate could be higher if the consultant has a particular expertise wells planned to charge 650 an hour emails show but bailey said he has dropped the hourly rate to 600 and it could go down further on first pass it seems high said hisd trustee mike lunceford who was absent from the board meeting involving wells hisd board member greg meyers who works for the university of st thomas said he abstained from the vote on the wells deal to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest wells is on the universitys board of directors board president paula harris said she supported hiring wells but thought after the vote that the district should have considered tying his fee to any cost savings realized its an accepted model to have someone look at your medical expenses and try and save you money said harris who said she knows wells but they arent close friends erickamellonchroncom

exemplary credentials marshall said of wells i had discussions with him in terms of my hopes and my dreams for the houston independent school district  wells said in an email that he could not respond to questions tuesday because he was out of town at a conference garrett touted wells credentials  he has done work for several major oil and gas companies  and said that as a doctor he would bring a different perspective from the districts other consultant mercer which helps to manage the benefits program the district paid mercer 48 million last year despite the vague documents sent to the school board about wells garrett said he would be given specific tasks such as lowering costs for the districts most chronically ill employees and reviewing changes to the workers compensation program she said wells would not focus on medical tourism because the district now has other priorities the district did not have to competitively bid the deal garrett said because state law allows for exclusive contracts for professional services including doctors if this item would come up tomorrow i would still recommend it she said we think to have someone come in and try to help us minimize our costs is the right thing to do  brad bailey hisds general manager of benefits emailed wells two days before the school board voted on his deal repeating a request to detail specific tasks bailey also asked wells if he had any connection to the costa rica trip which had been mentioned in a houston chronicle article wells did not respond to the questions according to emails and interviews from my perspective we still do not have a good definition around the first year goals for his services bailey wrote garrett a few days before the board meeting bailey said in an interview that his job is to ask difficult questions and he has had similar pressing discussions with other vendors grier said he wasnt involved with the details in the wells proposal but recalled meeting the consultant briefly at a meeting with marshall and garrett in january grier also signed off on a nocost contract with wells in march for a preliminary review of the districts benefits program records show we are not planning to write a blank check to this man for 650000 and then say heres what we want  grier pledged tuesday frances fowler the chairwoman of the american association of healthcare consultants estimated the typical hourly fee for a medical adviser at 450 to 500 but said the rate could be higher if the consultant has a particular expertise wells planned to charge 650 an hour emails show but bailey said he has dropped the hourly rate to 600 and it could go down further on first pass it seems high said hisd trustee mike lunceford who was absent from the board meeting involving wells hisd board member greg meyers who works for the university of st thomas said he abstained from the vote on the wells deal to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest wells is on the universitys board of directors board president paula harris said she supported hiring wells but thought after the vote that the district should have considered tying his fee to any cost savings realized its an accepted model to have someone look at your medical expenses and try and save you money said harris who said she knows wells but they arent close friends erickamellonchroncom

today about trips abroad taken by three trustees of the houston independent school district to recap houston school board member larry marshall last year took two trips to costa rica  arranged by state representative borris miles an insurance agent who contracts  with hisd and promotes health care options in the central american  nation marshall  confirmed the trips to the houston chronicle on thursday he recalled  touring clinics meeting a plastic surgeon who repaired the face of an  injured bullfighter and sailing through the treetops on a zip line he  said the trips were to study the possibility of reducing the houston  independent school districts health insurance bills by suggesting  employees get some medical care in costa rica  where a nonstop flight  takes 312 hours he noted thats a little  longer than las vegas he said but its a beautiful country and when  you look at medical costs those costs have driven some families into  bankruptcies you have to look at some options  miles  a houston democrat said the costa rican government picked up the tab  for the trips which included others from the houston area miles who  also attended did not say who else joined him but marshall was the  only one of the seven hisd trustees he invited to accept the offer see the email invite at the end of the blog post  board president  paula harris a friend of miles said she had taken family trips with  him but didnt join in the costa rican travels i really didnt think about it said harris who recalled that her last vacation with miles was about eight years ago harris  confirmed that she also has taken trips with another hisd vendor  nicole west who is a close friend harris said west  who has tutored  students in hisd installed security cameras in the district and  recently won board approval for painting contracts  joined her and  other friends at the last minute on a vacation to italy this year i paid for it on my credit card and i have all my receipts said harris  hisd board member harvin moore said the invitation surprised him my entire thought about it was what on earth  he said and then i just ignored it  but  moore said he did agree to take a trip to china last year which was  set up by the nonprofit college board which contracts with hisd moore  said the chinese government initiated the trip and hisd paid 900 for  his registration and the same fee for a district employee in the foreign  language department to attend regarding marshalls two trips arranged by a vendor and paid for by a potential vendor the government of costa rica marshall said he didnt believe he was required to report the travel on his official conflict disclosure form because he was there as a guest  there appears to be an exception in texas conflict disclosure rules for school board members when the vendor is present for the gift giving from hisds board policy which appears to reflect state law see sec 176003 the disclosure form shall provide among other matters disclosure of all direct and indirect interests related to the district as well as gifts honorarium and other payments that are unrelated to services performed or goods furnished by the trustee from any party who does business with the district or who is interested in doing business with the district this report shall not require the trustee to report food lodging transportation or entertainment

marshall the longestserving member of the board said he didnt believe he needed to file paperwork to disclose the trips because he was there as a guest of a district vendor hisds policy which appears to reflect state law for school board members says trustees do not have to file conflict disclosure reports if they receive food lodging transportation or entertainment from a vendor or potential vendor as a guest  you treat it as an event marshall said ive gone to baseball games with individuals and the lawyers have said as long as the sponsors present theres nothing to disclose  documents from the texas ethics commission suggest that state office holders unlike school board members still have to report gifts received as a guest  school boards if they choose can adopt the stricter

public citizen texas if hisd school board members are taking junkets to costa rica then voters and parents should have the right to know about that  marshall said he made the trips in april and november 2010 he said he spoke about the arrangement with one of miles business associates miles sent seven members of the hisd board at least one email about the trip on nov 4 2010 according to the

voted on super tuesday  rick santorum who was in the lead in all of the polls at the time probably dreams about it  and it might remain a big deal in the national race even on may 29 theres an open senate race for the first time since 2002 that was the first open race since 1993  these dont open up very often that could be a draw for voters and there are races for railroad commission and the courts which hardly ever penetrate the public consciousness the heat might be local this time heres our early watch list which well change as new information comes in during the two months between now and election day caveat this is an early list and might not include your favorite fight call and share argue this is politics caveat 2 the parties and the secretary of state havent taken the oath on

a democratic primary between ciro rodriguez a former congressman john bustamante the son of another former congressman and pete gallego a 22year veteran of the texas house in a swing district that promises a close race in november too against incumbent representative francisco quico canseco rsan antonio cd25 the lloyd doggett district that doggett wont run in this nowopen seat has a dozen republicans in it and might cost a fortune to win with its ends stuck in two expensive media markets of austin and fort worth cd27 blake farenthold like canseco might not have won in any year but 2010 now hes defending himself in a newly drawn district that stretches from his home in corpus christi up to bastrop three republicans are waiting for him and the winner will face one of four democrats

doggett not been squeezed out of his home district by the mapmakers now its an austin vs san antonio battle royale featuring doggett on the north and bexar county tax assessorcollector sylvia romo on the south it was drawn to give minority voters the upper hand but so was the district where doggett won after the last round of redistricting cd36 the last open district strongly favors the

House Budget Shrinks Spending, Slashes Services	2011-04-03	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2011/04/03/house-budget-shrinks-spending-slashes-services/	en	the texas house started with a 1645 billion budget and ended with the same total but lawmakers spent the better part of a weekend making changes inside the budget for 201213 before giving it their approval on a largely partyline vote of 98 to 49 late sunday night the debate began first thing friday morning carried into the first hour of saturday and then resumed late sunday afternoon the essentials remained the same with an overall plan thats 123 percent smaller than the current budget leaves public education and health and human services spending short of what it would take to maintain current services especially given population growth and inflation and requires none of the remaining 6 billion in the states rainy day fund or any new taxes though it does include 100 million in new fees appropriations chairman jim pitts rwaxahachie characterized it as a draft that will be changed over the next two months house speaker joe straus emphasized process telling members we need to move this bill  but house democrats chastised their colleagues for not using the rainy day fund to preserve programs from prekindergarten to financial aid and implored them to send the whole bill back to committee tonight our best simply isnt good enough said representative helen giddings ddallas the budget now heads to a senate thats on track at this midpoint to spend more money  about 10 billion for now  than the house and the reconciliation of those two disparate notions of state government will frame whats left of the legislative session if they cant find middle ground it could go into overtime in special sessions after the regular session ends on memorial day the weekend votes on the budget amendments went pretty much the way the republicans in charge wanted them to go just as they did on thursday when the house considered two pieces of legislation designed to fill the 43 billion deficit in the current budget democrats left after election day with fewer than a third of the votes in the house dont have the juice to make any changes by themselves that left them with a strategy of voting against the republicans on most things and when the majority offered them unpleasant choices  as in a series of amendments that cut family planning dollars and gave the money to autism and other programs democrats favor  to cast present not voting  they were neither for nor against on those issues for the democrats it was a way of disowning a republican budget for the republicans it was the difference between winning by a 2to1 margin and winning by near acclamation that says something about how the state representatives see the political risks here if they were worried about future general election contests against democrats republicans would be breaking away from the pack as local politics required instead they ignored the democrats and stuck to voting in favor of cuts and against more spending two votes broke the pattern one would move 35 million from the texas commission on the arts to the department of aging and disability services it passed by just six votes 6761 with pitts and former house speaker tom craddick among those on the losing side its the right thing to do said representative david simpson rlongview i have nothing against the promotion of the arts but austin is doing well on its own its the music capital of the world and we put the weak among us those who are dependent first  another would have moved 15 million from the governors film and music marketing budget into state aid for libraries it failed 7955 with pitts again on the losing side both of those votes broke the republicandemocrat pattern that prevailed on most of the votes on budget amendments members began working quietly right after the arts vote to bring it up later for reconsideration but couldnt find enough support to change the outcome conservatives successfully raided family planning funds in the budget stripping money from those programs and sending it to others including one for autism another for mental health services for kids and yet another for trauma care we dont choose between good and bad said representative wayne christian rcenter we choose between necessary and necessary  representative sylvester turner dhouston was on the other side of that argument and started the nonvoting with this line i will not be caught trying to decide whether to fund child one or child two  the debate on education issues lasted six hours members took money from the public school system for texas prisons and put it into community colleges they turned back an attack on the texas education agency that would have whacked its funding and cut the commissioners salary to 50000 from 186000 i dont know any of us that go home and say hip hip hooray for the tea said representative burt solomons rcarrollton the author of that amendment but after opposition from a fellow republican house public education chairman rob eissler of the woodlands the house voted to

alpine tried a frontloading amendment moving money from the second year of the twoyear budget to the first in the hope that the legislature will find money for the second year before it arrives that fell far short of being added to the budget before the house stopped early saturday morning members turned to a series of votes on controversial social and cultural issues one debate started a buzz inside and outside the capitol when christian proposed requiring family and traditional values centers at colleges and universities where any state money supports gender and sexuality centers or any other center for students focused on gay lesbian homosexual bisexual pansexual transsexual transgender gender questioning or any other gender identity issues  that was adopted overwhelmingly by a 11024 margin the next debate was ugly when christian proposed requiring that colleges and universities getting state funds should make sure that at least 10 percent of their courses provide instruction in western civilization  the line formed quickly at the back microphone where members can question people who are at the chambers front mike presenting legislation christian got flustered in his descriptions of what would and wouldnt qualify as western studies asked by representative borris miles dhouston whether that would include africanamerican or asianamerican studies christian suggested the first might belong in african studies miles who is black implored him lets take this down brother  but it went to a vote with christian and 26 fellow republicans voting for it and 108

After 18-Hour Debate, House Gives Early OK to Budget	2015-04-01	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2015/04/01/final-version-budget-story/	en	after 18 hours of debate that veered from polite disagreements to an angry outburst the texas house tentatively passed a 210 billion twoyear budget early wednesday morning with a 141 to 5 vote with more than 350 proposed amendments before them members of the house began at noon tuesday and ended at nearly 6 am wednesday after both the house and the senate have passed a budget a conference committee made up of members of both chambers will hash out a compromise version the senate finance committee is expected to vote out its budget to the full senate next week this is just another step in the process said house appropriations chairman john otto rdayton the chambers lead budget writer it is not the final product  the five no votes on the budget were republican state representatives matt rinaldi matt schaefer david simpson tony tinderholt and molly white while it may have taken longer than usual i am proud of the way members worked together on this budget and stayed focused on the needs of their constituents house speaker joe straus said in a statement wednesdays overwhelming vote is a testament to the leadership of chairman otto and his team  democrats concentrated their efforts on directing more funding toward public education while tea party republicans tried to defund economic incentive fund programs yet three areas expected to draw hot debate  abortion vouchers and instate tuition for the children of immigrants who entered the country illegally  were largely sidestepped as members pulled down their amendments state representative jonathan stickland rbedford withdrew an amendment that would have reduced state funding for a public college or university by the same amount that it awarded in grants or financial aid to undocumented students he said he was convinced to scrap the amendment after he was told antiabortion programs would get more funding we did some negotiations he said stickland was among several republicans who pulled amendments that would have likely prompted debates on the states illegal immigration policies democrats also withdrew more than a dozen amendments seeking to reduce or eliminate funding for the states alternatives to abortion program which provides counseling and adoption assistance after republicans pulled theirs the outcome mirrored a similar arrangement during a house budget debate in 2013 from our perspective there are some good things in this budget and we dont want to file amendments just to make a point state representative chris turner dgrand prairie said yet state representative bryan hughes rmineola said efforts to boost the programs funding were ongoing while republicans considered options for where the extra funding should come from the majority of the members agree that this is a good program hughes said the question is where to get the money  house members were widely expected to take up an antivoucher amendment tuesday that would have prohibited the use of state dollars to fund private education for students in elementary through high schools yet amid a flurry of lastminute opposition state representative abel herrero dcorpus christi withdrew his amendment voucher opponents were hoping the vote would pass as resoundingly as a similar budget amendment did two years earlier and send a signal that such proposals remained dead on arrival in the house even as they are gaining traction in the senate under the houses rules for the budget debate proposed amendments couldnt grow the budgets bottom line even though lawmakers have room to spend 2 billion more before hitting the states constitutional spending cap any increases in funding had to be offset by decreases elsewhere that dynamic led to dozens of amendments proposing a shift in funds from one program to another perhaps the strangest moment of the debate came during an intense exchange between state representatives stuart spitzer rkaufman and harold dutton dhouston over spitzers amendment to shift 3 million from hiv and std prevention programs to pay for abstinence education dutton asked spitzer if he had benefited from abstinence education spitzer said he had only ever had sex with his wife and since you brought it up is that the first woman you asked  dutton asked drawing some gasps from the house floor im not sure thats an appropriate question spitzer responded spitzers amendment ultimately passed 97 to 47 another tense moment came at around 230 am when state representative borris miles dhouston took issue with an amendment from state representative scott sanford rmckinney to reduce funding to the lottery commission miles accused sanford of being hypocritical for claiming to oppose the lottery because of its impact on poor people while rejecting amendments from democrats that aimed to help poor people now you have the indecency and disrespect that your lottery bill is about helping poor people  miles asked youre full of shit  sanfords amendment was adopted on a 91 to 52 vote house democrats have said they prefer their chambers budget to the one proposed in the senate particularly given the extra funding house budget writers are putting into public education but they have also expressed frustration that the house budget leaves more than 8 billion on the table including 2 billion below the states constitutional spending cap otto defended his budget noting that money must be left over for planned tax cuts governor greg abbott has said he would veto any budget that doesnt include tax cuts for businesses early in the days debate state representative trey martinez fischer dsan antonio proposed doubling a plan from otto to add 800 million to public schools if this amendments going to take 800 million to say education is a priority id like to make it 16 billion martinez fischer said this chamber is going to take seriously our mission to fix our schools  the chamber voted down martinez fischers proposal 103 to 44 the house also considered multiple efforts to defund economic incentive programs which have been under a harsh spotlight over the last year following a state audit that described the states texas enterprise fund as being run with lax oversight while proposals to end the incentive funds were touted by republicans on the campaign trail last year they gained little support in the house amendments from rinaldi rirving to defund the film incentive program and the enterprise fund each gained fewer than 35 votes of support the texas enterprise fund is a welfare fund thats antithetical to free markets rinaldi said supporters said the programs are needed to make the state competitive with other states that offer similar incentives if yall dont want it i hope you dont encourage any of your companies to apply state representative larry phillips rsherman said to members who supported defunding the program a proposal to examine whether women are underpaid in state government also failed to find enough supporters despite the issue drawing attention during last years gubernatorial race state representative mary gonzlez dclint offered an amendment to require the comptroller to publish an annual report comparing the salaries of men and women holding the same position in all texas state agencies such a report could be produced at a minimal cost she added as it would merely be compiling existing data this isnt just about fairness its about families gonzlez said when texas women are paid unequally their families suffer too  the amendment failed 8363 throughout the afternoon and into the night lawmakers pulled dozens of amendments and agreed to send other proposals to article xi the section of the budget sometimes referred to as the wish list but viewed by most lawmakers as the place where proposals go to die early in the day state representative yvonne davis ddallas managed to get 16 billion in extra funding for prekindergarten programs added to article xi house leaders have talked about boosting funding by at least 130 million to school districts that adopt certain prekindergarten curriculum and teacher quality requirements davis said she viewed her amendment as signaling a significant interest in the house to increase funding by much more than that to address a statewide need for more fullday prekindergarten programs article 11 while it feels good and sounds good im not nave enough to think its a commitment davis said julin

Do Scandals Necessarily Get Incumbents Defeated?	2010-09-29	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2010/09/29/do-scandals-necessarily-get-incumbents-defeated/	en	doublebilling taxpayers for travel expenses driving a luxury car owned by a state transportation contractor and repeatedly failing to pay taxes wont put a house lawmaker in good standing with the ethics police but whether a scandal is enough to get an incumbent ousted from office is anybodys guess state representatives joe driver rgarland linda harperbrown rirving and charles doc anderson rwaco are all hoping the headlines dogging their reelection bids wont follow them to the polls their democratic opponents are reveling in their misery at every campaign stop and photo op meanwhile two incumbent democrats fell to scandal this spring and a third was tripped up two years ago though he clawed his way back this year political consultants on both sides of the aisle say that whether such seats flipflop comes down to the three ts timing turnout and tradition how recently the news stories struck how many voters show up on election day and how long the lawmaker has been in office all contribute to whether a scandalplagued incumbent can ride it out for another term it can kill you or you can skate by every situation is unique says dean rindy a democratic media strategist it depends on how much local media is pounding the story how much scandal competition there is among other politicians at the time and how complicated the details are  spinning the scandals harperbrowns race was a tossup two years ago when she won by just 19 votes since then the house transportation committee member has gained the unfortunate nickname linda harperbenz following news reports that she was driving a 2010 mercedes e550 owned by her husbands employer a contractor with business at the texas department of transportation harperbrown has returned the vehicle but adamantly denies any wrongdoing she says voters are disgusted by the negative attacks and are rallying around her but her democratic opponent loretta haldenwang has worked hard to keep the scandal in the headlines earlier this month she showed up at harperbrowns office  media entourage in tow  to demand the incumbent return more than 11000 in mileage reimbursements she claimed for wear and tear on the vehicle people want to hear about the issues  they dont want to hear personal attacks harperbrown says theyre hammering on with all the negativity while im trying to discuss issues  on the other side of dallas county drivers in hot water after admitting he pocketed at least 17000 in taxpayer funds for travel expenses that he had already billed to his campaign driver says he got bad ethics advice  and has now repaid everything he owed but that may not be where the story ends the travis county district attorney who has purview over the state ethics investigations has confirmed shes looking into the case which means criminal charges could follow the driver campaign says thats highly unlikely  and that extensive polling since the news broke shows he will still win handily being a lifetime resident here i think people have known me for so long and realize a mistake was made driver says people do make mistakes which is why we stepped up and acknowledged it  drivers acknowledgment came after the associated press discovered his creative accounting speaking of accounting anderson a waco veterinarian has been hit in the last year with two federal liens for failing to pay about 70000 in back taxes anderson has said that the liens were the result of a dispute with the irs and that he has paid them off in full former democratic state representative john mabry  whom anderson defeated in 2004 the first cycle after 2003s middecade redistricting  could stand to benefit from the incumbents black eye but todd smith a gop consultant working with anderson says he thinks his candidate has a strong hold on the district opponents are just regurgitating the same story they laid out six months ago and it doesnt seem to be having any impact in the district at all smith says docs working like hes 20 points behind but we feel very confident about where he is in the race  getting away with it whether these scandals affect the outcomes of any of these races remains to be seen harperbrowns race was going to be close regardless shes a longtime fixture in irving but her district has become increasingly latino and working class dynamics that often hurt republicans drivers doublebilling broke late in the game  and jamie dorris the democratic candidate in the heavily republican 113th district was endorsed by the dallas morning news despite being a political novice who currently lives with her parents in waco the jurys out on whether mabry a democrat can return to office in largely republican mclennan county dallas county gop chairman jonathan neerman says driver and harperbrown will both probably be safe because theyre well known in their north texas districts and have a long history of service to the state my concern is what impact the scandals will have on the rest of the republican ballot in this county he says there may be people who used to be traditional straightticket voters who wont vote for a particular candidate anymore that increases the risk of losing people all the way down the ballot  a trip down badmemory lane offers little firm guidance on which types of scandals lead to lost elections and which arent dealbreakers after all in some cases money matters former state representative gene seaman

Not Quite Right	2010-05-24	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2010/05/24/not-quite-right/	en	its not always the big transgressions that bedevil public people its the understandable ones george hw bush was ridiculed for his supposed wonderment at a bar code scanner in a store a moment his foes turned into a metaphor for being out of touch it might not be his ruin  who the heck knows at this point  but rick perrys twoyear subscription to food  wine magazine  unearthed by the associated press in a story on what he spends on his house and entertaining from public and from private funds  is just that sort of thing its a clinker a funny sound coming from an undisclosed location in your car a buzz in the speakers a gnat in the ear an irritation hard to ignore the big story here has been told the perrys moved out of the governors mansion so it could be renovated while that was going on an arsonist  still at large  torched the historic building now its being repaired and renovated in the meantime the perrys are living in a 18 million home in the hills west of the capitol at a monthly cost of 10000 whats new here is detail and context the context is the governors reelection campaign against democrat bill white in which perry is continuing the positioning he started in his primary campaign against kay bailey hutchison to wit hes from texas and not washington and hes one of us the detail is that damned magazine subscription and the two chefs on the payroll all paid for with state funds it raises a political question that doesnt suit perrys positioning has he been in austin so long that hes gone native he might be better off if hed been reading field  stream or garden  gun the political nugget here is that the twoyear sub to food  wine was surprising and offbeat  outside the public idea of who the governor is politicians can do all sorts of things and survive so long as what theyre doing remains inside the bounds of what people know about them for the master class on this look to the late charlie wilson the former state and federal legislator known as much for being a rascal and a scamp as for secretly appropriating money to pay for arms to help the afghanis push the soviets out of their country wilson survived a series of personal behavior scandals in part because he didnt really surprise anyone they knew he was a scamp its when they dont know  when a pol does something big or small that violates the public image  that the trouble starts it can be big stuff like running for us senate from connecticut and telling people you served in the marines in vietnam then getting outed for serving in the marines during the war but not in the war that was richard blumenthal whos in for a very interesting round of campaigning on memorial day it can be small stuff like running a magazine ad featuring men in military uniforms like lieutenant governor david dewhurst did a few years ago one uniform was that of an officer in the german luftwaffe if blumenthal survives he really will have a war story of sorts dewhurst was embarrassed but came out fine and still holds the office he was after back then in the first case the opponents are exploiting it dewhursts opponent let the matter drop in perrys case the texas aflcio offered up a mobile home for 1 year to house the governor and his bride until the mansion is back in business theyre trying to put legs on the story  to keep it alive the only way to know if this is really a problem for the guv is to wait a couple of weeks to see if people are still talking about it and if theyre talking about it outside of austin hillary clintons push for healthcare reform during her husbands presidency could help texas and 19 other states suing the federal government stop the current legislation texas attorney greg abbott said on thursday abbott said the he felt pretty good that the coalition of states would triumph partly due to concerns raised in the 1990s the issue about an individual mandate violating the commerce clause was actually first raised back in the time of hillarycare and it was picked up once again in the beginning stages of obamacare abbott said during a panel discussion hosted by the texas public policy foundation these arent novel legal theories and it isnt the first time that congress has been warned about the possibility  the new legislation is scheduled to cost texas 25 billion in its first 10 years of implementation he said abbott said congress is banking on the commerce clause in the us constitution to prove it has the authority to issue what he called the individual mandate that requires everyone to buy health insurance the commerce clause may allow congress to regulate commerce but it doesnt allow congress to force americans to buy things they dont want if congress can force you to buy insurance there is not limit to what they can force you to buy he said the attorney general said another promising sign is that despite the governments expansion of what it includes in the commerce clause the supreme court has issued decisions that have struck down legislation passed by congress as a violation of the clause twice in 15 years there is a growing movement among the supreme court justices and among courts in general to understand that there must be some limit to congressional power and i can assure you that if there is any limit to congressional power it will be the limits established in this healthcare mandate he said because a team of legal professionals has committed to pursuing the lawsuit largely for free he said texas could likely spend less than 10000 battling congress a 5000 6000 or 7000 tab in an effort to save 25 billion is a pretty good return on investment he concluded everyone assembled in this weeks joint session of the house higher education committee and the appropriations subcommittee on education agreed texas universities need to do a better job of graduating students what they couldnt agree on was how to get universities to encourage their students to complete their degrees this is particularly urgent in this session said higher education commissioner raymund paredes in 2009 we had largest enrollment growth in the history of the state  paredes thinks the census date that determines funding levels currently set for the 12th day of classes should be moved to the end of the semester representative mike villareal dsan antonio questioned whether that proposal would inspire the kind of transformational change needed im not sure theres a one size fits all formula tweak that does that villareal said he mentioned the need for professors to spend more time mentoring their students representative scott hochberg dhouston advocated for more attentive guidance counseling to ensure that students are taking the correct courses required to graduate higher ed committee chairman dan branch rdallas said that a funding incentive could alter the outlook of the administrators who set the tone for a university and make hiring decisions thus creating a desired trickledown effect in the mindset of an institution but questions lingered if paredes specific tweak creates the proper incentive after looking at the data representative jimmie don aycock rkilleen and newly sworn in representative van taylor rplano both expressed doubts that any correlation exists between course completion and graduation rates however they do it lawmakers want it done how about until you at least meet national peers hochberg asked the educators no new majors no new programs no new degrees  senator john cornyn announced his support last week of a democrat for the federal prosecutor position in the dallasbased northern district but that doesnt mean texas is anywhere close to getting its first us attorney cornyns pick is sarah saldaa currently an assistant us attorney charged with investigating corruption in public offices shes supported by a variety of leftleaning and latino interest groups including the league of united latin american citizens lulac and the hispanic national bar association shes known as a loyal democrat her husband is also active in democratic circles the hitch is that house democrats from texas who dont have any official standing here still arent on board and while they arent officially in the assembly line here  these are presidential appointments confirmed by the senate without any stops or drivebys in the house  theyre players because the white house is paying attention to them cornyns office meanwhile believes there may be another reason the housies are kicking sultanas resume includes the successful prosecutions of former dallas mayor pro tem don hill and former state representative terri hodge ddallas a staffer said that may be the reason why they  in particular us representative eddie bernice johnson of dallas  arent behind the nomination johnson did not return a request for comment on the issue us representative lloyd doggett daustin who is also active in the review of federal prosecutor candidates however fired back in an email that tweaked cornyns opposition to kaplan a senator who didnt think that justice sonia sotomayor was qualified to sit on the us supreme court and is currently complaining about elena kagan seeks to avoid important questions what legitimate objection do you have to us magistrate jeff kaplan a respected jurist selected by federal judges with both republican and democratic histories serving as us attorney for the northern district  so what about the other districts the eastern is languishing after an agreedupon nominee john b stevens withdrew his name from consideration citing the protracted confirmation process theres no consensus candidate in sight in the southern where the senators are standing firm behind career us assistant attorney and republican ken magidson and in the western district a cornyn staffer familiar with the process told the texas tribune back in april that the nomination of michael mccrum who was also on the house delegations list of possible nominees was forthcoming  the runoff for kip averitts empty seat in the texas senate will be held on tuesday june 22 governor rick perry set that date after former senator david sibley of waco and retired lt col brian birdwell of granbury finished first and second in the special election earlier this month the winner will hold averitts seat until january when the winner of the general election in november will take over right now the favorite is averitt who hasnt given up the republican nomination for another term even though hes resigned from the senate if and when he withdraws the political party chairs in sd22s ten counties will pick a nominee for the november ballot for sibley and birdwell and others thats the real race  put michael barnes on your list of candidates for chair of the texas democratic party the south texas schoolteacher says its time for fresh blood for change and besides he says since when is zero for 29 a winning record  hes referring to the number of statewide elected offices held by texas democrats the current chairman boyd richie of graham is the only other candidate at this point the democrats state party convention  where the next chair will be elected  is set for june 25 in corpus christi  expect that mobile home now parked at the texas aflcio to move around between now and november a portable taunt of the governor and his current living setup in a 10000month house in tony west austin an op on the democratic side gave us a hint the other day remember that mobile home is mobile  its looking bleaker for the 2011 legislative sessions budget writers the nowforecasted 18 billion shortfall will have to be resolved without new taxes according to top officials but the first cuts  for the current budget and not the next one which has that hole in it  amounted to only 12 billion after reviewing the recommended cuts from state agencies governor

media outlets as far away as the uk are reporting on the state board of educations upcoming vote on new social studies textbook standards the controversy hasnt lost any luster or bluster over the last few months as board members continue to offer amendments to the standards reflecting what some characterize as their political and religious points of view the ranks of more than 200 people who signed

negotiation with mexico or any other nation  texas attorney general greg abbott to former texas solicitor general ted cruz you are the youngest person to ever serve as a solicitor general in the state

time for an immigration policy that permits temporary guest workers to fill jobs americans will not take that rejects amnesty that tells us who is entering and leaving our country and that closes the border to drug dealers and terrorists  those words uttered by former president george w bush hit at the heart of why arizonas recently signed antiimmigrant law will ultimately be an exercise in futility and a complete failure to reduce undocumented immigration and border violence much has been written about the possible negative effects of the arizona law loss of liberty by lawabiding us citizens who may now be asked by government to provide papers please additional unfunded state mandates on local law enforcement that will reduce their effectiveness in fighting crime and increased discrimination against latinos or other ethnic minorities instead of debating those issues and assessing what harm the arizona bill might do it is important to focus instead on the failure of the arizona law because of what it does not do the arizona law misses the mark because it fails to address the underlying problems with our broken borders first the arizona law does not and cannot create an effective and legal system to match willing workers and willing employers while the immigration debate in our country frequently devolves into emotional slogans and inflammatory rhetoric the causes of immigration are quite simple if we stop demagoguing illegals and understand immigration as transnational labor flows driven by hostcountry employment then solutions become attainable until we align our immigration system with us labor needs in a legal framework we will continue to see an increase in undocumented workers arizonalike enforcementonly laws will have littletono impact on this larger macroeconomic dynamic in fact despite already having among the toughest antiimmigrant state laws on the books usa today citing us border patrol statistics reported this week that arizona is the only border state where illegal crossings are on the rise  second the arizona law does nothing to address the insatiable appetite for drugs in the us that funds and arms murderous drug cartels and corrupts and destabilizes the mexican government immigrant housekeepers gardeners cooks nannies construction workers and farmers working throughout the us cannot be blamed for this brand of border violence we need to look at ourselves as a responsible link in a vicious and destructive cycle we buy the drugs the money goes to the cartels the cartels buy our guns with our money the cartels buy government officials on both sides of the border with our money the cartels murder thousands of people in mexico and some in the us using our guns and our money the arizona law will not stop border violence because it does nothing to address this cycle third the arizona law does not and cannot resolve the situation of the 10 million undocumented immigrants in the us by allowing them to earn their way to legal status during recent legislative sessions members of the texas association of business and the mexican american legislative caucus not conventional political allies under normal circumstances found common ground by identifying several principles that each group supported as a step to comprehensive immigration reform those principles outlined an earned path to legal status that includes a criminal background check learning basic english and american civics payment of any fines for unlawful entry and payment of any back taxes after meeting those requirements an immigrant would get in line with other wouldbe citizens elected and business leaders who support comprehensive immigration reform realize that patchwork and piecemeal approaches will continue to fail we have seen the negative effects of arizonalike initiatives here in texas in the district i represent the town of farmers branch elected to pass a particularly misguided antiimmigrant ordinance back in 2007 that was successful only in dividing a community tarnishing the towns image and costing nearly 5 million in attorneys fees arizona might be fortunate that the antiimmigrant law is destined to fail if all the undocumented workers and their families in arizona are stopped identified and deported the negative economic impact of such actions would worsen an already deep deficit that has forced the state to raise sales taxes the perryman group has estimated that if all unauthorized immigrants were removed from arizona the state would lose 264 billion in economic activity and approximately 140324 jobs like arizona texas will face a challenging budget deficit in 2011 as legislators we should devote every second of our time and every ounce of our effort next session to ensure that we balance the budget in a thoughtful and responsible manner and we should demand the same from our texas congressional delegation and call for as president bush did thoughtful and responsible comprehensive immigration reform anchia ddallas represents district 103 in the texas house the law passed by the state of arizona merely codifies federal law in that state if one has a problem with the arizona law one must also have a problem with the federal law if the federal law was enforced there would be no need for an arizona law or any other law in a state that is proposing similar legislation when washington dc speaks of illegal aliens the number living in the united states has never changed in the past eight years it is always estimated at 8 million to 12 million there are many agencies in the united states that keep track of illegal aliens and use a number somewhere between 20 million and 30 million in texas for example the estimated number of illegal aliens is 2 million and since passage of the arizona law many more are heading east to the lone star state two years ago with the passage of strict legislation in oklahoma dealing with their illegal population illegal aliens headed south across the red river to come to texas our numbers continue to grow the texas department of criminal justice reports that we have 12500 illegal aliens in our state prisons and an estimated 12500 in our county jails when law enforcement officers were required to take training under section 287g of the homeland security act before dealing directly with illegal aliens texas was promulgating a double standard if a texan was detained for any violation traffic or otherwise and failed to have personal identification on him he could be asked any question including immigration status and arrested if warranted however illegal aliens could not be questioned on their immigration status it was a major headache for every law enforcement officer in texas except for those who worked in socalled sanctuary cities homeland security secretary janet napolitano recently suspended the 287g training president obama stated last month that the us congress did not have the appetite to take up the immigration issue what better time than now to exercise our states rights and sovereignty under the tenth amendment to the us constitution the federal government has failed to deal with the immigration problem it falls upon the states to seal their borders and deal with illegal aliens as they would with any other lawbreakers even if the federal government did act we would certainly see amnesty with a pathway to citizenship for 30 million new citizens who would instantly have access to all of our social services when i raised my right hand as a legislator and placed my left on the holy bible i swore to preserve protect and defend the constitution and laws of the united states and the state of texas that is a solemn oath to me and too many of my colleagues quickly forget it it is our duty to protect the citizens of texas from the crimes committed by illegal aliens in our state especially from those who make up 50 percent of the gangs who deal in drugs and commit murder theft and drunken driving as well as those who drive without a license or liability insurance the major criticism i have heard of the arizona bill is that it may lead to profiling other hispanics who are loyal longtime texas residents but he profiling argument is a case of using race when no other legitimate objection is available to prevent the bill from passing the bill would apply to everyone and can be written in a way to avoid profiling of any kind many members of our law enforcement community are hispanics and a sound education program resembling the 287g training can be part of the bill our law enforcement officers must have the capability of dealing fairly and legally with all residents in the state of texas i fully intend to introduce similar legislation in the next session of the texas legislature to honor my oath of office to protect the citizens of texas and to assert our state sovereignty under the tenth amendment to the us constitution berman rtyler represents district

Sorting It All Out	2010-03-08	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2010/03/08/sorting-it-all-out/	en	the governors race is just what you expected republican rick perry and democrat bill white perry starts with the power of incumbency and the states 16yearold preference for republicans over democrats in statewide office white starts with the advantage of nonincumbency  dont snort at that  and the ability to run a more serious and wellfinanced campaign than anyone in his party has run in some time five independents have signed up and the libertarians will choose their candidate in june lieutenant governor republican david dewhurst v democrat linda chavezthompson dewhurst is the incumbent and is rich enough to finance a big campaign even if donors werent willing to give to a sitting lite guv chavezthompson is a firsttimer on the ballot her career was in the labor movement which could help and democrats hope her gender and ethnicity will help the ticket add a libertarian to be named later attorney general incumbent republican greg abbott v democrat barbara ann radnofsky abbott had his eyes on a promotion but it was based on kay bailey hutchisons sketchy plans to resign freeing up a horde of pols from all parties to run for her office or for the offices emptied by people running for her office she hasnt quit nothing has opened up radnofsky who lost to hutchison four years ago is making her first bid for ag libertarian jon roland and independent ruben torres are also going to be on the ballot comptroller republican susan combs without major party opposition the comptroller is one of the five state officials on the legislative redistricting board a panel that rises out of dormancy every ten years to draw the political maps the legislature almost always fails to complete even so the democrats didnt field a challenger libertarian mary ruwart will also be on the ballot in november land commissioner incumbent republican jerry patterson v democrat hector uribe this is another of those lrb seats lieutenant governor house speaker and attorney general are the others and is far enough down the ballot that the outcome often has more to do with the political mood of the state than with the candidates themselves james holder is the libertarian in this one agriculture commissioner incumbent republican todd staples v democrat hank gilbert a rematch staples got 55 percent last time to gilberts 42 percent libertarian clay woolam got the rest at the starting gate the financing of the two candidates is lopsided in staples favor the libertarians will chose from two candidates in june railroad commissioner republican david porter v democrat jeff weems both parties are paying close attention to this race all of a sudden after the republican incumbent victor carrillo lost a somnambulant campaign for reelection and turned this into an open seat the libertarian in this contest is roger gary supreme court republican incumbents paul green and eva guzman will face democrats bill moody and blake bailey respectively democrat jim sharp will face the winner of a runoff between former lawmaker rick green and fort worth family court judge debra lehrmann court of criminal appeals michael keasler the incumbent republican will face democrat keith hampton in the only race where both the ds and rs have candidates congress nobody in the texas delegation even got nervous on election night the worst performance of the night by an incumbent was us representative ralph hall who pulled 573 percent of the vote with five people running against him seven of the challenger races  those with candidates who seek to challenge incumbents in november  are headed for runoffs texas senate only eight texas senators will face opponents in november and the only two who had real primaries this time  kip averitt in sd22 and steve ogden in sd5  won easily averitt has said he doesnt want another term the details of that read below are still being worked out el paso senator eliot shapleigh isnt seeking reelection in sd29 former el paso county attorney jose rodriguez won a threeway primary and will face republican dan chavez in november texas house eight members didnt seek reelection five more lost their reelection bids and three more have to win runoffs to survive to the november round in the open seats dr charles schwertner won the republican primary to replace representative dan gattis rgeorgetown in hd20 sergio muoz jr won the democratic primary to replace representative ismael kino flores dpalmview in hd36 the race to replace representative brian mccall rplano in hd66 will go to a runoff between mabrie griffith jackson and van taylor former wichita falls mayor lanham lyne won the gop primary to replace representative david farabee dwichita falls in hd69 in the hd84 race to replace carl isett rlubbock mark griffin and john frullo will meet in a republican primary runoff next month walter four price won the republican primary to replace representative david swinford rdumas in hd87 former bexar county commissioner lyle larson easily won the republican primary to succeed representative frank corte rsan antonio in hd122 what started as a fourway republican contest to replace representative joe crabb ratascocita in hd127 is now a twoway between dan huberty and dr susan curling the five who lost lance gooden beat his former boss representative betty brown dterrell by 183 votes in hd4 ron reynolds defeated representative doro olivo drosenberg in a democratic primary rematch in hd27 she won in 2008 by fewer than 200 votes representative tommy merritt rlongview lost decisively to david simpson in hd7 merritt one of the republicans who helped replace house speaker tom craddick with joe straus has been fending off primary challengers for year and seemed genuinely surprised to lose in hd43 freshman representative tara rios ybarra dsouth padre island fell to jose manuel lozano in a contest closely watched and heavily financed by lawyers and tort reformers the latter group was on the losing side representative al edwards lost a rematch against former representative borris miles in a houston democratic primary but thats probably not over only 11 votes separated the two in hd146 the three on life support representative fred brown rbryan only got 44 percent in the first round of his reelection bid and will have to claw his way out of a runoff with gerald buddy winn in hd14 representative delwin jones rlubbock finished first but not first enough hes got an hd83 runoff with charles perry next month representative norma chavez del paso finished second in her primary but stayed alive for a runoff against naomi gonzalez in hd76 challengers in a couple of closely watched primaries are heading for runoffs in hd47 paul workman and holly turner face off next month the winner will face representative valinda bolton daustin in november john gordon and larry gonzales have a runoff in hd52 with democratic representative diana maldonado of round rock waiting for the winner scary but okay after all representative chuck hopson of jacksonville easily won his first election as a republican in hd11 he switched parties in november drew two gop challengers and got 61 percent of the vote representative burt solomons rcarrollton almost got mugged by mike murphy a self identified tea party candidate who came within a few hundred votes of an upset in hd65 solomons got out with 53 percent of the vote representative vicki truitt rsouthlake held off three challengers in hd98 and won without a runoff the best rundown of races and numbers is available at the texas tribune or you can look at the numbers compiled by the texas secretary of state the official source the real gift to governor rick perry on tuesday wasnt the win over kay bailey hutchison and debra medina in the gop primary which was foretold in the polls it was the quick win a runoff would have gobbled six weeks and something like 10 million and might have left the winner bruised on the way into a battle with democrat bill white a serious opponent who easily bested six others in his partys primary so how does the november election shape up weve been targeted since day one on general election issues says dave carney perrys chief political consultant todd olsen a fellow republican who worked for hutchison for a short period last year chimes in hell just say im running a great campaign why change anything white must introduce himself to texans before perry has the opportunity to do it for him hes well known in the houston media market  the states biggest  but hes a cipher most everyplace else people in the hinterlands dont have any impression of him at all his job is to make sure its a positive one perrys job is the opposite of that to turn him into what carney described in a recently leaked strategy memo as a big city trial lawyer anti gun sanctuary city promoting clinton protg dc politician  white has to be ready he has to distance himself from obama and washington democrats says matthew dowd a former george w bush strategist and now a founding partner in the austinbased vianovo consultancy he needs to cut them off as quickly as he can  thats going to give him the only shot i think to win this race  itll be harder for white to attack perry the governor has been defending himself politically for 20 years and is pretty much a known quantity to voters its hard to redraw that picture and white like hutchison before him will have to find a way to get through perrys defenses its silly to think this is going to be any more competitive than chris bell carney says citing the democrat who lost to perry in 2006 texas is a republican state and thats the single biggest obstacle to a democrat seeking statewide office much less the statewide office that gets all of the attention in election years the next biggest is that voters are in a national frame of mind meaning theyre focused on national issues and partisan fights at the federal level in texas generally speaking thats a bad environment for democrats  especially when the democrats are in charge barack obama didnt win here health care reform as explained in the public square isnt popular here even if the state ranks highest in the percentage of its citizens who are uninsured nobody likes deficits perrys the best campaigner in the state you dont have to like that to see it hes undefeated having just won his eleventh statewide race in a row and hes beat a roster of middle and heavyweights that includes jim hightower john sharp tony sanchez carole keeton strayhorn bell kinky friedman and hutchison the guys got chops then again white is the first democrat in a while who has the potential to spend the same amount of money on the race perry will spend call it a draw on resources the governor has been able to whistle past it so far but this isnt a great time to be an incumbent whites not in office now and as houston mayor a nonpartisan job he was able to attract and keep the support of republicans in that city some of them hes hoping will stay on board for his first state race he hasnt run statewide but was the chairman of the texas democratic party and can tap into a political network with connections far beyond his home city perry has said repeatedly that he doesnt want to run for president though suspicions and speculations abound that might help white attract outofstate money from people who are weary of presidents wearing western boots and from people who want to block perry its easier and cheaper to beat him now the theory goes than to wait around while he gathers political power and strength perry got the attention of the folks in washington with his win over hutchison whos a known quantity there and was high in the senate republican leadership before the race for governor beating her like an unranked team beating a ranked one moves him up in their estimation hutchison did perry a favor on the way out with a healing gesture in her concession speech he ran the race he needed to run and she exited stage right in a graceful way saying we should united behind the governor olsen notes as for hutchisons own campaign the trailer was a lot better than the movie what was originally billed as a blockbuster rivaling the 1990 democratic primary for governor turned out to be a dud with perry leading in all but one poll from june 2008 until election day hutchisons critical troubles included things of her own making and things she couldnt control  dithering over whether to quit the senate or not will she or wont she  became a major theme of her campaign story and that wasnt an advantage for hutchison from any angle it culminated in a commercial featuring hutchison sitting in a living room explaining why she wasnt quitting the senate opening with this clunker im going to do everything i can to stop the government takeover of health care and its why im staying in the senate through the primary at risk to my political future   wasting the first half of 2009 a period when perry was completely and fully employed by the legislative session and barred by law from raising money for his campaign during the session itself the month before and the weeks after  using roughly a third of her media budget for commercials attacking perry for toll roads for roads built by foreign contractors and for proposing a nowmothballed road system called the trans texas corridor the ttc was a prominent subject in the 2006 race for governor  strayhorn tried to pour that concrete around perrys feet  that didnt work as a political issue then and was even weaker in 2010 with the economy and jobs foremost in voters minds hutchisons campaign was trying to attract support with the wrong lure  running in a year when it was bad to be an incumbent and worse to be an incumbent from washington hutchison complained that the political environment forced her to run into a headwind and thats right perry positioned himself  as he has in previous elections  as a populist thats not hutchisons nature in the first place and this wasnt a good year to be a leader on a pedestal and he defined her as a washington politician sticking her with a label her campaign was unable to overcome a year ago the conventional wisdom was that a bigger turnout in the gop primary would transform that very conservative forum helping hutchison by bringing in more moderate republicans and hurting perry by diluting his base but the turnout in the gop primary was the biggest ever and as we now know perry was the beneficiary  running after 16 years in federal office those recorded votes in the us senate are murder in state elections whether youre a republican or a democrat a texan or something else and the washington tradition of bringing home the bacon for your state is out of style right now porks off the political diet  hutchison didnt look like she wanted the job voters get to play employer and the candidates present their virtues point out the flaws of their competitors smile chew breath mints and look like they really are ready to hit the ground running perry did hutchison didnt and where his pitch was focused on the economy the condition of the state and how to beat back washingtons encroachment she spent more time talking about his deficiencies than her own strengths that 1990 democratic race  the primary that set the mark for bloody inside fights  ended with a runoff that gave ann richards the nomination she was in such awful political shape that april that only a series of mistakes by clayton williams and a revival in her own campaign saved her and got her elected governor this years republican primary didnt come out looking like that 1990 race and perry didnt suffer the chips in his paint job that richards had 20 years ago democrats are hoping the state is coming full circle that this general election will run more like that earlier one claytie williams lost that year but he and us senator phil gramm pulled enough republican voters to the polls to sneak a couple of their own into statewide offices agriculture commissioner and state treasurer that had been held by the democrats for decades their names were rick perry and kay bailey hutchison sure turnout was big but it was a lot bigger in the marquee race than the stuff that followed on the gop side 1484111 people voted in the race for governor the drop was precipitous after that 1175608 in the lieutenant governor race 1165646 in the attorney general race and so on it jumped back to 1206988 for the competitive railroad commission race and to 1123575 for a sixway race for the texas supreme court before beginning to lag again competitive races were more popular than those with only one candidate the last statewide race on the gop ballot  an uncontested primary for the court of criminal appeals attracted only 997270 voters  a drop of 485841 from the top statewide contest on the democratic side the numbers were smaller but the trend was the same in the race for governor 679877 people voted 592149 voted in the next contest for lite guv and it fell and rose with the contested and uncontested races from there that last cca contest drew 469223 people  a drop of 210654 from the race for governor early voting on the gop side of the governors race totaled 598854 or 404 percent of the overall vote in the democratic primary for governor 294577 people voted early  433 percent of the total vote  republicans got more votes out of their top ten counties than democrats got out of the entire state and they got half of their statewide vote out of just 12 counties harris tarrant dallas bexar collin travis denton montgomery williamson fort bend lubbock and brazoria  the first 50 percent of the democratic primary vote involved just eight counties harris dallas bexar travis hidalgo el paso webb and tarrant  more than twothirds of the 2163988 people who voted  686 percent  voted in the republican primary  bill white won the democratic nomination in his home county getting more votes in harris county than the next nearest candidate  farouk shami  got statewide  democrats outvoted republicans in only four of the states top 20 counties measured by voter registrations el paso hidalgo cameron and jefferson  forgive us our wonkiness on this one the biggest voteproducers for the gop in terms of turnout advantage over the democrats were in order tarrant harris collin dallas denton montgomery lubbock williamson bexar and brazoria on the other end democrats netted more votes in these counties than republicans hidalgo webb el paso cameron jefferson maverick starr duval jim wells and zapata overall more republicans than democrats voted in 189 counties  perrys five highest vote counts came in harris tarrant dallas bexar and collin counties whites were harris dallas travis bexar and hidalgo the governor got 50 percent of the vote or more in 113 of the states 254 counties his stinker was carson county where he got 109 of the 1057 votes cast debra medina got 557 votes and hutchison got 391 white who had a less competitive primary got less than 50 percent in only 17 counties his worst showing was in montague county where 19 of the 294 voters went for him and 255 went for alma aguado kinky friedman got flushed by hank gilbert in the democratic primary for agriculture commissioner and the biggest single contributor to gilberts margin was travis county  friedmans hometown home of the state capitol and heart of the hill country where friedman made his name the kinkster lost this latest race by 27513 votes travis county contributed a net 9821 to gilbert harris county was good for another 7685 youre free to argue about whether its a disadvantage in a republican primary or an advantage in a democratic primary to have an hispanic surname but this is true if you dont run an effective campaign something other than your charms will decide the thing victor carrillo chairman of the texas railroad commission blamed republican voters for his upset loss issuing a press release saying in effect that his name lost him the race he didnt say but maybe should have that he left to chance a reelection contest that was his to lose his funding was paltry by statewide standards  he spent less than candidates often spend in congressional and senate races that involve much smaller numbers of voters former state senator david sibley rwaco is talking to people about getting back into the legislature when senator kip averitt rwaco gets out averitt decided after filing for reelection that he wants to do something else but it was too late to get off of the ballot and without any effort he won the gop nomination tuesday night for a job he no longer wants hes got two decisions to make hes the gop candidate until he withdraws his name from consideration and hes a state senator until he resigns or his term ends if and when he withdraws his name from consideration for reelection the chairs of the ten county republican parties in sd22 will vote to choose a successor to put on the ballot darren yancy who lost to averitt on tuesday would like to get that support but sibley is working the chairs too averitt could resign from office setting up a special election before he takes his name off of the ballot the local party people wouldnt be required to give the november ballot spot to the winner of that special election but the results could sway their decision averitt has to resign by the first week of april to force a may election after that governor rick perry would have the option of calling an election immediately or waiting until the next election date in november reached on the phone after the election averitt said hes not ready to make a comment about his plans other than repeating his desire to leave i am out of here  frank sturzl who is retiring from the texas municipal league after 31

How the 2010 Texas Primary Races Turned Out	2010-03-04	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2010/03/04/how-the-2010-texas-primary-races-turned-out/	en	not every race turned out the way political insiders  or the candidates themselves  anticipated here are a dozen primary races that defied conventional wisdom stunned incumbents and shocked longshot contenders railroad commissioner republican incumbent victor carrillo got his race handed to him by challenger david porter losing by more than 20 percentage points governor rick perry hand picked the petroleum geophysicist for the commission in 2003  replacing tony garza who was named us ambassador to mexico by george w bush  and helped elect him to a sixyear term in 2004 he spent far more money than porter a midland accountant 620960 vs 33684 since jan 1 2009 according to the eightdayout reports filed with the texas ethics commission his loss fuels a theory that he and others are propagating that republican primary voters are less likely to vote for people with hispanic surnames hd4 representative betty brown rterrell fell 108 votes short of her primary challenger lance gooden a relatively unknown insurance consultant who used to work for her as an aide the tenyear incumbent gained notoriety last legislative session for suggesting that asians change their names to something easier for americans to deal with  her loss was unexpected but maybe it shouldnt have been  she narrowly won her gop primary two years ago the race is likely headed for a recount hd7 no one was more surprised about representative tommy merritts upset than merritt himself the longview republican lost to former avinger mayor david simpson by just over 5 percentage points despite raising more money than his tea partybacked opponent though hes a 13year incumbent merritt has had a target on his back in past primaries too  largely because of his independent voting streak i just got caught up in the business of lets get rid of the incumbent merritt said tuesday night it was a total surprise  hd11 everyone wouldve understood if chuck hopson had lost or at a minimum gone to a runoff switching parties doesnt generally endear a candidate to primary voters but in his first race as a republican hopson won against two opponents with more than 61 percent of the vote in his jacksonville district  a wider span than he achieved in his last two elections as a democrat hd20 the race to replace retiring representative dan gattis rgeorgetown seemed destined for a runoff but dr charles schwertner an orthopedic surgeon won a solid 55 percent of the vote two of his three challengers  former legislative council chief milton rister and former cedar park councilmember stephen thomas  had pretty high name id but schwertner outspent them four to one an investment that helped him avoid a runoff hd27 fort bend democratic representative dora olivo an 11year incumbent lost to challenger ron reynolds  who she beat two years ago but it wasnt just a narrow upset reynolds an attorney won by more than 15 percentage points this is a race not too many folks were watching which made the turnover unexpected hd43 everyone knew representative tara rios ybarra was vulnerable everyone thought her election could be a squeaker the race had been nasty with references to her alleged extramarital affair with a south padre island developer who also donated to her campaign but no one expected kingsville businessman jm lozano to wallop her by more than 13 percentage points ending her career in the legislature after one term lozano won despite rios ybarras best financial efforts she outspent him by about 115000 hd65 first republican representative burt solomons drew an unexpected primary opponent then the influential house state affairs chairman with a hefty warchest had an election night win that was too close for comfort solomons defeated tea partybacked former congressional candidate mike murphy pulling in just 53 percent of the vote in his carrollton district murphy a 36yearold political consultant was a formidable contender honing in on immigration and voter id measures hd83 the fact that longtime lubbock representative delwin jones is headed for a republican runoff is no surprise  but his opponent is jones will face accountant charles perry and not zach brady a wellfunded wellconnected attorney who insiders expected would make the cut in the threeway race jones received 39 percent of the vote well short of the 50percent mark needed to avoid a runoff perry got 32 percent compared to bradys 29 percent despite the fact that brady raised a hefty quartermillion dollars for the race hd92 legislative observers had been prepping tarrant county republican representative todd smiths political obituary for weeks but he came out strong on tuesday night defeating former bedford city councilmember jeff cason with nearly 60 percent of the vote smith won handily despite casons strong financial backing and highprofile endorsements the tarrant county republican party chair endorsed cason and though cason and his allies alleged that smith was responsible for stalling controversial voter id legislation last session it didnt affect the outcome of the race hd98 southlake representative vicki truitt pleasantly surprised her supporters on tuesday night winning a solid 52 percent of the vote in a fourway republican primary that many believed was headed for a runoff truitt has won easily since claiming the seat after a 1998 gop runoff but she feared this race would be different because of a burgeoning tea party movement and strong antiincumbent sentiment in her district hd100 the only person shocked about attorney eric johnsons win over embattled incumbent representative terri hodge is the dallas county democratic party chair who predicted hodges longtime allies would vote for her despite  or maybe because of  her guilty plea in a citywide corruption scandal but johnson an innercity kid turned ivy league lawyer won by a much wider margin than anyone predicted with 75 percent of the vote though hodge backed out of the race in february it was too late to take her name off of the ballot meaning johnson had to continue to campaign so voters didnt inadvertently elect the disgraced incumbent hd146 when a tennis ball lands on a net its always a surprise former representative borris miles race against current incumbent representative al edwards is no exception miles leads edwards by an 11vote margin in the 10000vote democratic primary race which will almost certainly end with a recount the men are no strangers to rivalry having competed to represent the mostly minority houston district twice before edwards won the seat in 1979 and has held it ever since aside from a twoyear period between 2006 and 2008 in which miles dislodged him sboe 5 the shocker in state board of education member ken mercers race that it was hardly a race at all though challenger tim tuggey had a stacked lineup of support in san antonios republican community  including auto magnate red mccombs and heb chairman and ceo charles butt  mercer won handily with 69 percent of the vote mercer is a member of the sboes social conservative voting bloc though the blocs future is fragile in light of other election night outcomes sboe 12 talk about an upset longtime north texas sboe member geraldine tincy miller was narrowly defeated by political unknown george clayton in a race that almost no one had been watching miller who has been on the board for more than a quarter century spent more than 30 times more money than clayton did but clayton whose platform includes sending all curriculum proposals to school district teachers for a vote won with nearly 52 percent texas tribune donors or members may be quoted or

Perry and White Way Out Front	2010-02-15	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2010/02/15/perry-and-white-way-out-front/	en	governor rick perry is well ahead of us senator kay bailey hutchison and former wharton county gop chair debra medina who are locked in a statistical tie for second place in a gop gubernatorial primary that could go to a runoff according to a new university of texastexas tribune poll perry had the support of 45 percent of selfidentified republican primary voters  short of the majority required for an outright win hutchison had 21 percent and medina had 19 percent a twopercentagepoint divide thats smaller than the polls margin of error in the democratic primary race former houston mayor bill white has a huge lead over his next closest challenger businessman farouk shami pulling 50 percent to shamis 11 percent five other candidates are in the running for the democratic nomination the survey found that only 9 percent of those polled prefer someone other than the two frontrunners undecided voters are still significant in both gubernatorial primaries on the republican side 16 percent said they hadnt made up their minds pressed for a preference 51 percent chose perry 34 percent chose hutchison and 15 percent chose medina  an indication that perry could win without a runoff if he can attract those voters into his camp among democratic voters 30 percent were undecided and of those 48 percent when pressed said they lean toward white with white already at 50 percent that means shami would have to strip votes away from him in order to force a runoff or to claim a win the numbers show significant erosion for hutchison since the first uttt survey in late october when perry had 42 percent of selfidentified republican primary voters to her 30 percent medina at the time had 7 percent debra medina has turned this thing upside down said jim henson director of the texas politics project at the university of texas at austin who conducted the poll with daron shaw a professor of government at utaustin debra medina has clearly become a wild card in the republican gubernatorial primary race shaw said she caught everyones attention in the debates and is riding a bit of a wave the analytical question is who does she hurt more on the one hand she has been reasonably effective in critiquing perrys stewardship and conservative credentials on the other hand she cuts into hutchisons claim as the most plausible vehicle for change  white who now apparently is running away with the democratic race wasnt even in the running in october he was in the midst of an exploratory race for the us senate based on the idea that hutchison would resign and there would be a special election to replace her and only joined the gubernatorial contest on december 4 shami wasnt a declared candidate either and many of those who were in the race  tom schieffer ronnie earle kinky friedman and hank gilbert  got out undecided voters led with 55 percent in our first poll of the democrats in general election matchups the republicans trump the democrats perry would beat white according to the new poll 4435 hutchison would too and by the same margin 4334 in our earlier poll she outperformed perry in hypothetical general election matchups medina and white would tie 3636 shami would lose a hypothetical race to perry 4825 to hutchison 4923 and to medina 4024 democratic primary voters have a couple of other statewide races to decide in the contest for lieutenant governor  the winner will face republican incumbent david dewhurst in november  labor leader linda chavezthompson took 18 percent of those polled former travis county district attorney ronnie earle got 16 percent and restaurateur marc katz had 3 percent five percent of voters said they wanted somebody else and a whopping 58 percent remain undecided on the eve of early voting which begins on tuesday kinky friedman and hank gilbert  two refugees from the governors race now running for agriculture commissioner  are locked in a tight race 32 percent to 27 percent while friedmans ahead the difference is within the polls margin of error and as with the lite guv race undecided is actually leading at 41 percent the winner will face incumbent republican todd staples in november in the fantasy special election to replace hutchison in the senate  she has said she plans to resign before her term ends no matter how the gubernatorial race turns out  democrat john sharp leads with 29 percent followed by dewhurst at 15 percent and five more republicans clustered in low single digits with each at 3 percent or less all told the gop votes add up to 24 percent besides dewhurst the candidates polled were sportscaster craig james 1 percent railroad commissioner elizabeth ames jones 2 percent state senator florence shapiro 2 percent railroad commissioner michael williams 3 percent and former secretary of state roger williams 1 percent thats the rub in this race sharp is the only democrat left now that whites out while the republicans have to share their partys votes even so undecided sits atop the heap at 47 percent in the earlier uttt poll white and dewhurst were tied at 13 percent with sharp at 10 percent a special election would go to a runoff if nobody got a majority in the first round in the last such election in 1993 hutchison finished first barely in the first round of voting with thenus senator bob krueger the dominant democrat in that race she trounced him in the second round texas remains a red state as evidenced by respondents answers to generic party questions about congress and the legislature without picking specific candidates 44 percent said they would vote for the republican in a race for congress to 35 percent for the democrat 17 percent were undecided asked the same question about the texas legislature 43 percent chose the republican and 36 percent chose the democrat with 18 percent undecided how strong is the tea party movement and who does it steal votes from asked the generic congressional question with that movement included as a third organized party 21 percent said they would choose the republican 36 percent would choose the democrat and 16 percent would vote for the tea party candidate more than a fourth  27 percent  said they were undecided so the democratic numbers held while republicans lost 16 points to the tea party and the rest to undecided the electorate is responding to whatever it is theyre associating with the tea party  at the expense of the republicans henson said while thats not necessarily to the advantage of the democrats he said it will have an effect on the majority party the tea party is going on in the republicans house  the internet survey of 800 registered voters was conducted february 17 and has a margin of error of  346 percent the gop primary questions have a  512 percent margin of error the democratic primary questions have a margin of error of  602 percent this is a math problem nobody thought of until now with kay bailey hutchisons support waning in recent polls rick perrys holding and debra medinas gaining its in the best interests of both of the oldtimers to jump on the newcomer perrys hope is that the people who left hutchison for medina will leave medina for him and get him to that elusive majority hes been chasing for four years hutchison at worst needs to finish second in the primary  with perry falling short  to get into a runoff and to stay alive for another six weeks or so after march 2 she needs to reclaim the people who appear to be leaving her for medina so everybodys ready to dogpile and medina gave them the opportunity by leaving the door open for questions about us responsibility for the 911 attacks on the world trade center in new york city radio host glenn beck asked her if she is a 911 truther who believes the federal government had a hand in the attacks i think some very good questions have been raised in that regard medina responded there are some very good arguments and i think the american people have not seen all of the evidence there so i have not taken a position on that  her full comments are online here perry pounced saying anyone who would suggest 911 is a conspiracy involving the bush administration should be ashamed  hutchison pounced too calling the comments an affront to the men and women who are sacrificing their lives to root out the terrorists in afghanistan and around globe  and former fema director and prominent bushie joe allbaugh  not an elected official seeking office was blunt ms medina  this is nuts  the question now is whether medinas voters care about this and whether it changes their mind about how and whether theyll vote in the gop primary the differences in the top democratic candidates for governor are pretty clear in their first and probably only televised debate bill white sounded experienced as youd expect of a threeterm mayor of houston and he kept his reputation for being sober and wonky farouk shami a wealthy houston businessman was more passionate more animated and much more prone to political mistakes he offered several statements that will make simple work for anyone who feels the need to attack his candidacy to wit   on economic development i will guarantee everybodys job   on reviving the economy i will guarantee 100000 jobs in texas in the first two years or i will give the state 10 million   on immigration without mexicans it would be like a day without sunshine   on his wind and solar energy plans my aim for the state of texas  within 10 years you will not have an electric bill  it only lasted an hour but voters got a chance to see real differences in the two candidates shami would support a moratorium on the death penalty white would not white would leave the laws on abortion alone shami is prochoice but only for the first 60 to 90 days of a pregnancy shami wants a moratorium on barnett shale drilling because of pollution from benzene white wants standards that would be enforced against bad actors while leaving other companies free to drill an increase in gas taxes is not where i would start white said but he later added that he favors a legislative proposal that would allow local option gasoline taxes for transportation projects shami would support an increase in gasoline taxes for roads with competitive primaries in several districts theres been no shortage of attention on the state board of education races between conservative and moderate republicans but among those watching are democrats waiting to find out what kind of a race theyll be running against a farright republican with a record or the new businessstyle republicans challenging them rebecca bellmetereau whos running for ken mercers district 5 seat has been gaining name recognition  a recent endorsement from henry cisneros helps she says the republican primary outcome wont matter too much my message would essentially be the same she says it seems very obvious to me that we need educators on the state board of education  with 15000 on hand bellmetereau is the financial frontrunner of the four democrats running for the seat she says her biggest hurdle in the race will be getting the money to compete with republicans tim tuggey the republican challenger has 36000 on hand currently and mercer received 35000 from a single donor in 2006 we dont have these very large donors throwing their weight around says bellmetereau we dont have anyone coming around and saying heres thirty thousand dollars  but harold cook a democratic consultant whos worked with bellmetereau says she should hope for a mercer primary win mercer has been an outspoken member of the conservative bloc and has written extensively on his opposition to evolution and support for traditional math and english teaching the distance is shorter with mercer he says bellmetereau isnt the only one running and the races are too small to warrant any polling daniel boone a candidate with recognizable name says money is not going to be the determining criteria in the race thats probably good for him since hes only got 3300 on hand but whats his strategy i have worn out a good pair of shoes already he says  abby rapoport score another one for sergio muoz jr as he tries to replace state representative kino flores dpalmview to represent hd36 muoz a democrat this week picked up the endorsements from pharr mayor leopoldo polo palacios and the citys commissioners in a statement on the muoz campaigns web site palacios states muoz the son of former state representative sergio muoz could help grow the city of pharr and add to its emerging reputation as a major trade hub in the state the endorsement follows last weeks nod from mission mayor beto salinas and that citys commissioners who announced last week their support for muoz over his challenger sandra rodriguez she is a former school board member and probation officer who narrowly lost to flores in 2008 rodriguez seems unfazed by the endorsements and is confident she has support from community leaders even though they havent said so publicly the commission here in pharr they are supposedly saying the mayor is with him muoz but not all the commission is with him she says he claims that the school board is all with him well there may be a few members but i have half of them  voters wont have to wait until november to see whom their next representative is there are no republicans or libertarians vying to represent the heavily democratic district the primary winner is going to austin next year  julian aguilar mabrie jackson picked up endorsements from the dallas morning news and texas parent pac the race itself is heating up the best example is a voyeuristic web video advertising a former business of candidate wayne richard which was removed from the web after it came to light a disagreement is brewing over who has and has not signed a taxpayer protection pledge committing to fighting all tax increases candidate van taylor released an ad saying he is the only one to have done so but now both of his opponents say they have too representative chuck hopson was honored by the texans for lawsuit reform and awarded the tlr civil justice leadership award the kilgore news herald reported that senator florence shapiro rplano was in attendance and said of the democratturned republican i dont care if hes a democrat or a republican the truth of the matter is hes chuck hopson  in hd 38 it was a week of gab throughout the week the four candidates for representative dan gattis seat were traversing the district in a series of six forums but they have enough to brag about milton rister received the texas home school coalition endorsement and another

The Talk Shows	2010-02-01	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2010/02/01/the-talk-shows/	en	friday nights second and final debate between the republican candidates for governor might as well be called the debra medina show  while the two bigname contenders  kay bailey hutchison and rick perry  are trying not to make any careerthreatening gaffes shell be trying to add momentum to an outsider run that has made her the most interesting candidate in the race sponsored by dallasbased belo corp and broadcast or at least offered to tv stations across the state the debate will feature the trio questioned by reporters in a television studio without an audience the first debate two weeks ago was held in a packed auditorium in denton and now the two leading democrats hair care entrepreneur farouk shami and former houston mayor bill white have agreed to debate thats a kerasponsored event in fort worth on monday february 8 other sponsors include the fort worth startelegram ktvttv ktxatv kuvn univision 23 texas association of broadcasters texas state networks and the freedom of information foundation of texas and its the only debate theyve got slated medina cant afford to waste her last certain moment on center stage she doesnt have millions of dollars to spend on television advertising so this is a rare chance for her to talk to the whole state or at least the part of it that watches republican political debates on friday nights what does she want the same thing that happened the first time around she says she came out of the first debate with a bloom that helped her shoestring campaign raise more than 100000 in a week a former wharton county gop chair ron paul supporter and failed candidate for state gop chair medina was the big winner in the first debate put on stage with two fellow republicans whove each been in statewide office since 1991 she held her own she wasnt goofy  a way of saying that expectations were low and that she easily exceeded them in fact she put perry in particular on the ropes with a couple of her responses voters looking for an outsider had their standardbearer the risk of course is that she loses steam after this debate is over and voters see a barrage of ads from perry and hutchison and nothing from her early voting starts on february and the election is on march 2 in real terms thats soon in political terms thats plenty of time for a minor candidate to disappear for perry the best offense on friday night is a great defense dont make noteworthy mistakes no news is good news if theres nothing really interesting in the papers the next day its all good for the guv and drop the attitude after the first debate some viewers thought perry was abrasive and fidgety it didnt rise to the level of the sighs that undermined presidential candidate al gore in his first debate against george w bush but it went on perrys stage notes inside and outside the campaign with no crowd in the room this time hell play to the cameras instead of the cheap seats the idea is to be mr positive and to try to deflect attacks on him as attacks on the state the idea is that anyone criticizing him is talking trash about texas hutchisons strategy lies somewhere in between candidates who think theyre in solid positions before debates follow the same rule doctors follow first do no harm shes got to protect the standing shes got  more debates are decided by screwups than terrific performances  while also taking perry down a few notches one option is to smile and nod as medina rips perry letting the third candidate damage the frontrunner but medina also sent a few arrows in hutchisons direction in the first debate and hutchison needs to land some blows too hutchisons campaign insists in conversation with supporters that the race between her and perry is neck and neck and thats how shes been acting a candidate as far behind in the polls as perry claims she is somewhere in the double digits would probably have opened the arsenal by now instead she was assertive and confident in the first debate and landed a few jabs on the incumbent though medina was more direct and more effective as when she criticized perrys boasting about jobs and the growing state budget hutchison like perry wants to avoid mistakes so in sum medina needs to make it to the highlight reel after the debate to keep people talking and to fuel her grassroots campaign perry wants an empty highlights reel and hutchison wants something that hurts perry either directly or by helping medina her best outcome is to win outright in march second best is for medina to force a runoff between hutchison and the incumbent governor and medinas best chance might come in this debate early voting in the party primaries starts in less than three weeks the election in less than five while there are nearly 200 legislative races on the ballot only a few are real contests heres a rundown of the ones worth watching were not taking a global view here  these are seats that are being fought over in the march 2 primary people who are in trouble in november have time to prepare the folks in trouble in the primary are in trouble right now its not a comprehensive list just because there are two people on the ballot doesnt mean theres a noteworthy battle brewing and its not a final list it will change several times in the next few weeks with new information new candidate actions and reactions and so on well publish an updated list as primary day approaches the toughest race on everyones list including ours hd11 representative chuck hopson vs michael banks vs allan cain hopson a jacksonville legislator switched parties  to the republicans from the democrats  in the first week of november the republican powersthatbe in austin were generous in their support and praise of a move that after all firms up their tenuous hold on a nearly evenly split texas house but not everyone is on board hopson is running against two other republicans banks in particular is well known in jacksonville there are four counties in the district cherokee where jacksonville is houston rusk and panola hopsons in a primary hes never run in before all the democrats whove been helping him with phone banks and blockwalking are on the other team now hes got a conservative voting record but hes also voted with the democrats on lots of measures and voters arent fawning over incumbents at the moment democrats will have a hard time winning the district without hopson on their side of the ballot but some of them would love to see him lose just for switching and some republicans  within and outside the district  would rather have a republican legislator whos been a republican all along hopson carried the district by around 120 votes two years ago and is used to close races now hes got a new political team and everybodys attention the weirdest race sd22 senator kip averitt vs darren yancy averitt filed for reelection and has a primary opponent and then announced  after it was too late for him to get off the ballot or for someone else to get on  that he doesnt want another term in the senate hes a moderate yancy is more conservative watch for yourself on youtube averitts from waco and yancy is from burleson  a distinction thats more important than party affiliation in some parts of sd22 waco would like to be the geographic center in the 10county district but if yancy wins itll move to johnson county no democrat filed in the race and if yancy wins hell face only a libertarian in november if averitt wins the republicans will get to pick a new candidate and because election laws say so the democrats will too averitt has talked to some supporters about resigning before the year is out  as opposed to serving out a term that ends next january if he does that there could be a special election on top of all this however it falls unless averitt has an unexpected change of heart there will be a new senator from central texas next year not really a race but congress conventional wisdom is that nobody in the congressional delegation is in real trouble conventional wisdom almost always sides with the incumbents though and its hard to calculate the electoral power of tea partiers and others angry at washington and entrenched establishmenttypes in both parties us representative chet edwards dwaco is perpetually at risk his is the most republican district in the country represented by a democratic congressman and ciro rodriguez dsan antonio is in a seat where voters generally like republicans more than democrats in statewide elections but those are general election worries the discontent among conservatives produced 11 contested gop primaries this year ralph hall rrockwall drew five opponents but hes been in contested primaries since switching parties a couple of election cycles ago and has survived with relative ease nobody in congress from texas is on the march watch list at this point other incumbents at risk in their party primaries republicans hd83 representative delwin jones vs zach brady vs charles perry jones one of the 11 renegade republicans who toppled house speaker tom craddick in 2009 faces tough challenges this time focused gently on his age hell be 86 in april and on calls for change brady in particular is mounting a strong challenge hd98 representative vicki truitt vs rich deotte vs diane thorpe vs giovanni capriglione whether youre worried about this has something to do with where you are its high on the austin list if the conversation involves consultants and lobbyists and political financiers truitts folks are talking it down hd7 representative tommy merritt vs david simpson merritt draws opposition every time and has held them off so far every time simpson is the former mayor of avinger sd5 senator steve ogden vs ben bius the incumbent bryan republican faces businessman bius who has run unsuccessfully for other offices ogden brought this on himself saying last september he wouldnt be back bius got into the race as did representative dan gattis rgeorgetown gattis talked to ogden and got out of the race ogden got back in bius stayed ogdens got a race and the advantage hd4 representative betty brown vs lance gooden she used to be his boss hes running on time for a change  democrats hd100 representative terri hodge vs eric johnson hodges trial on public corruption charges starts just days after the primary so johnsons got something to talk about hes also a harvardprincetonpenntrained attorney with his own practice hes organized and raising lots of money other dallas democratic officeholders  at least at the state level  are sticking with hodge but johnson is getting some support from locals advantage the challenger hd146 representative al edwards vs borris miles edwards lost to miles in 2006 and then won the seat back in 2008 the third times just charming hd43 representative tara rios ybarra vs jose manuel lozano the first race for reelection is the hardest rios ybarra a dentist from south padre island who defeated incumbent juan escobar in 2008 has a tough wellfinanced opponent she has a messy divorce case thats made headlines and that might be behind her depending on whether her opponent wants to stir the pot but she also has the backing of texans for lawsuit reform and others who helped her win last time primaries where the winners will challenge targeted incumbents in the fall hd47 david sewell vs holly white turner vs paul workman the winner will face representative valinda bolton daustin in a district where voters like statewide republicans bolton held off a stiff challenge two years ago and the republicans are hoping as in other districts that some of her strength came from a democratic surge in 2008 that wont be there they hope in 2010 hd52 stephen casey vs alyssa eacono vs larry gonzales vs john gordon the figuring is the same as in the bolton race with this difference representative diana maldonado dround rock is in her first defense of the seat and hasnt been battlehardened by tough reelection contests gonzales and gordon appear to be in front of the pack hd78 luis rene diaz vs robert kleberg vs dee margo the winner will face representative joe moody del paso in what was for years a republican seat in the texas legislature jack vowell held it followed by pat haggerty margo lost to moody last time kleberg and diaz are new to this hd101 greg noschese vs cindy burkett vs thomas latham start at the back of the alphabet latham a former state representative lost a primary challenge in 2008 to the guy who then lost to robert miklos now the democratic incumbent burkett owns subway franchises and is making her first run noschese was a mesquite city councilman miklos is running for reelection for the first time and the republicans want to see if he was a fluke winning in a district that belonged to the gop for years hd105 kim limberg vs loretta haldenwang the winner will face representative linda harperbrown rirving who had the narrowest margin of victory of anyone in the legislature on the 2008 ballot less than two dozen votes open seats where the incumbents have opted out hd20 milton rister vs charles schwertner vs stephen thomas vs patsy williams this is the race to replace representative dan gattis rgeorgetown whos not seeking reelection rister and schwertner seem to have a jump but thomas was on the cedar park city council and has a political base expect a runoff hd36 sergio muoz jr vs sandra rodriguez representative ismael kino flores dpalmview holds the seat now he defeated sergio the elder and is related through his wife in 2000 and then survived a strong challenge in 2008 from rodriguez flores political forces are with muoz hd66 mabrie griffith jackson vs wayne richard vs van taylor a race to succeed representative brian mccall rplano with no democrat on the horizon the winner here will likely take office barring an unprecedented libertarian surge jackson quit the plano city council to make the race and is the establishment favorite taylor ran for congress against chet edwards a couple of cycles ago and has the ability to selffinance hd69 joe clement vs lanham lyne lyne the former mayor of wichita falls is the favorite in the race to succeed representative david farabee dwichita falls hd84 ysidro gutierrez vs mark griffin vs john frullo outside of lubbock griffin is the best known of the candidates to succeed gop representative carl isett whos not seeking another term hes a former texas tech regent who says he was asked to leave for supporting kay bailey hutchison over governor rick perry who appointed him hd87 victor leal vs walter price representative david swinford rdumas is leaving a district thats ripe for extinction when the new redistricting maps are drawn in 2011 its republican territory now and the winner of this primary will face democrat abel bosquez in november hd122 denise barnhill vs lyle larson in the race to replace representative frank corte rsan antonio larson the former county commissioner has the deeper electoral history hd127 martin basaldua vs susan curling vs dan huberty vs addie wiseman this race to replace representative joe crabb ratascocita is going to be expensive and its a hard race for some trade groups for instance basaldua and curling are both doctors wiseman is a former houston city councilwoman huberty is an energy exec and president of the humble school board all four had respectably stout fundraising numbers at the end of the year with curling leading the pack in cashonhand a distinct runoff possibility its no secret that the seats occupied by us representatives chet edwards dwaco and ciro rodriguez dsan antonio are high on the gops texas takeover list now freedom works a conservative group closely aligned with the tea party movement released its list of targeted us congress races and edwards and rodriguez both made the list of potential targets  these are races the pac is monitoring but has yet to commit to backing a candidate for election or conversely targeting one for defeat  freedom works is founded and chaired by texas own dick armey the former us house majority leader hes been very active in state politics lately most recently spotted campaigning for us senator kay bailey hutchison if freedom works does decide to go after edwards presumably by backing whichever of the five republican primary candidates comes out on top they will have to put up some serious cash the edwards campaign announced that it began the year with over 13 million in the bank  more than its ever had at the beginning of an election year the national republican congressional committee has thrown their support behind

association of business will wait until after the super bowl to kick her campaign into high gear jackson is also the favorite of retiring state representative brian mccall rplano her opponent van taylor who recently received the empower texans pac endorsement is already running television ads department of corrections we misnamed charles schwertner of georgetown in last weeks edition his first name is charles and not whatever we said then sorry sorry sorry julian aguilar reeve hamilton abby rapoport morgan smith to understand why it takes so long to get election ballots together in texas it helps to know that some people still dont use email that political candidates fill out forms incorrectly and that the mail is sometimes slow prosaic enough but the result is maddening especially in an age of instant everything the deadline for candidates to file for state office in texas was on january 4 the political parties had ten days after that to pull together their lists and report their certified ballots to the texas secretary of state in fact the sos finally got lists posted on its website on monday january 25 thats the first time  three weeks after the filing was over and candidates were already working raising money knocking on doors and speechifying  that texans could get a definitive list of candidates as presented by the political parties from the states chief election office republicans are here democrats here we have some people who havent joined the 21st century and they have to wait for mail and so on says bill holcomb of crockett head of the texas democratic county chairs association hes the houston county chairman and says he and the state party had their business wrapped up within less than a week after the filing deadline others were much slower the deadline is simple enough but texas has 254 counties and all but a handful have party officials and if a candidates political district doesnt cross any county lines candidates file locally instead of at their state party office as it turns out thats a lot of candidates twothirds of the 150 texas house are singlecounty districts for instance ive never seen a reason for it to be at a local level its easier for a central agency to collect and distribute the money from filing fees holcomb says things go wrong candidates make mistakes on their forms and can be disqualified for big ones their checks bounce sometimes undoing their political plans is must be dotted and ts must be crossed new people have to be trained for instance the texas democratic party has chairs in 247 counties and 102 of those people werent in office the last time elections were held its ripe for error you get a green chair in there trying to fill out a state reps application and theres a mistake then youve got egg on their face holcomb says both parties have the same setup the primaries are actually party elections but the state runs the mechanical parts state officials get the lists of candidates from the parties and proceed from there the filing is handled by party officials and volunteers  not by state election workers if i dont get it just right then its usually the candidate whos got the problem says lampasas county gop chairman br skipper wallace whos also the legislative chairman of the texas republican county chairmens association hes been in the lampasas job since 1991 and tries to help candidates avoid filing mistakes a guy wants to run for office i say let him run for office  but new chairs around the state fret over all of the things that can go wrong its reinventing the wheel every two years he says wallace says hes in favor of anything that would improve the system but competing interests often kill reform attempts one argument is that its best to leave a longstanding system for fear that change would just trigger a slew of mistakes another is that local pols dont really care to deal with the state party but would rather work with local officials who are closer to their own political interests in some counties chairs want the candidates to go through them and not through somebody up in austin its a matter of being close to the locals says wayne hamilton a former executive director of the texas gop who is now a political consultant he says legislators and some party people have tried to change the system through the years  to make state candidates file at the state party level for instance  but the local outcry from some places has been too strong to overcome lawmakers will probably tinker with the election code next year theyve certainly got a lot to tinker with for instance in 2003 they moved the primary election date from the second tuesday in march to the first tuesday in march candidates are still required to file on the first business day of the year but the deadline for withdrawing from the ballot wasnt changed and is still set at 62 days before the election this time the deadline to get on the ballot was on january 4 but the deadline for getting off was days earlier on december 30 lawmakers will probably try to fix some of those glitches and could change the filing procedures while theyre in there wallace who testified against legislation that would have made some changes to the filing  letting candidates in onecounty districts file at the state level to avoid local politics for instance  is for an overhaul of the states election code thats one of the things we need to do is rewrite the whole thing he says it is a convoluted mess it is very difficult even for lawyers to interpret and most of us who do this are not lawyers  to hear buck wood tell it the texas association of business with bill hammond at the helm unscrupulously used corporate donations to run attack ads against state legislative candidates and didnt disclose properly to hear andy taylor tell it wood lives in a fantasyland and tab plays by the rules the stories arent exactly easy to reconcile wood representing three democrats defeated in the 02 election made new moves on the lawsuit that alleges tab illegally raised money from corporations that year and spent it on ads with direct political messages to voters not only were the actions illegal says wood but none of it was disclosed properly tab and its corporate conspirators schemed to spend unreported corporate funds to support or defeat candidates for the texas house of representatives he said wood wants to proceed with hammonds deposition which was delayed while criminal charges proceeded taylor who represents the defendants in the case says its all spin  and hes already moved to stop the deposition what we said the day the lawsuit was filed in 2002 is what were still saying in 2010 says taylor tabs public education program was 100 percent protected free speech  taylors account is quite different from woods he says that because the corporations gave money to tab and not its political action committee the donations were legal furthermore he argues the mailers werent express advocacy because they never specifically exhorted recipients to vote for or vote against anyone  the socalled magic words test not that it matters taylor says the most recent us supreme court case citizens united v federal election commission allows a corporation like tab to become express advocates without concern about the magic words  we win under the old standard but now we really win he said wood doesnt see it that way the magic words test was never the test he proclaims there were some circuit courts of appeals that adopted it and said it was the test but its not binding at all  his lawsuit argues that the new supreme court decision in citizens united vs mcconnell shows that tabs fundraising efforts required a higher level of disclosure thats why i cranked this thing back up he explains the lawsuit has already dragged on for almost eight years taylor says he will continue to fight wood other defeated candidates from 02 have already dropped their lawsuits and only woods clients remain from the sounds of it dont expect resolution any time soon abby rapoport us senator john cornyn will join a band of senators led by us senator lisa murkowski ralaska pursuing a joint resolution of disapproval against the environmental protection agencys recent greenhouse gas endangerment finding when aimed at a government agency a resolution of disapproval isnt just a collective scowl from the direction of capitol hill it can block an agency ruling from becoming law the congressional review act of 1996 passed by republican majorities in both houses and intended to allow the legislative branch to push back quickly against regulation authorizes congress to nullify an agencys regulatory decision 60 days after it receives a report of the finding cornyn and his senate colleagues and their counterparts in the house led by us representative jerry moran rkansas dont like the epa ruling because it lays the foundation for the clean air acts regulation of greenhouse gases which would hurt economic growth according to opponents they could choose to propose preemptive legislation but thats not strategic because even with 51 41 votes now in the senate democrats could easily filibuster the bill or kill it in committee under the cra murkowskis resolution has the advantage of being filibusterproof but thats about it if it gets through both chambers not easy as democrats control the house the president still has to sign off on it and the obama administration is a serious roadblock for any pols hoping to derail the epas endangerment finding said environmental attorney richard faulk who chairs the litigation department of the gardere law firm thats why faulk said he sees the resolution as more of a political move than something thats realistically going to change anything  because it has to get past the president a transition between administrations where a newly elected executive wants to do away with rules passed by his predecessor  is when a resolution of disapproval has the best chance at survival according to veronica stidvent director of the lbj schools center for politics and governance the only resolution proposed under the cra to successfully undermine an agency ruling emerged under those circumstances in 2001 when george w bush took office he signed a resolution passed by the gopcontrolled congress against an ergonomics rule that restricted repetitive stress associated with physical labor issued by the clinton labor department a review of legislative records since 1996 shows that congress has seen almost 50 different resolutions of disapproval under the cra  seven of which targeted epa rules morgan smith 1 a report in the dallas morning news revealed governor rick perry

her thumb and get it over with  the us supreme courts recent decision in citizens united violates every principle of constitutional decisionmaking  and will be remembered as a judicial coup dtat intended to tilt the 2010 elections the courts majority in overturning the prohibition on corporate and union funding for election ads went out of its way to declare a major congressional law unconstitutional even though its bedrock procedural doctrines dictate that the court should avoid doing so whenever possible these doctrines may seem like technical niceties but they actually reflect core american legal values deference to the peoples representatives in a democracy an understanding that an unelected court should shun political issues and our humble and wise tradition of courts deciding just the specific matter before them the citizens united thumbs its nose at all that first the court addressed and decided an issue not brought by the parties citizens united an advocacy nonprofit that took little corporate money renounced in the trial court its facial challenge that the corporate prohibition on funding independent political ads was unconstitutional in all circumstances citizens united asked the supreme court to decide only whether the corporate funding prohibition was unconstitutional as applied to them in their narrow fact situation the court decided on its own to address the facial challenge holding the statute unconstitutional as applied to all corporations even forprofit corporations in all circumstances there was no evidence in the record that there were exceptional circumstances and the supreme court would be hard pressed to prove them since the country has had a corporate campaign prohibition since 1907 and we have had no apparent shortage of vigorous free speech the courts power grab constitutes activist judicial arrogance second the court easily could have decided if it had wanted to the case for citizens united without addressing the constitutional question it could have held that the statute which banned corporate and union funding of television ads referring to federal candidates within thirty days of a general election did not apply to a videoondemand movie as was involved in this case it could have held that citizens united fit a longstanding exception for certain advocacy nonprofits that take little or no corporate funds however the court could not control its ideological desire to eliminate the corporate prohibition on funding electioneering that has been the law of the land for over 100 years and upheld by both conservative and liberal courts  until now last but not least the court violated the conservative principle of stare decisis stand on the decision which means the it should follow its prior decisions except in very special circumstances how special the court did not even expressly overrule in brown vs board of education its infamous decision in plessy v ferguson creating the doctrine of separate but equal  stare decisis allows the public and policymakers to rely on prior court decisions and protects the integrity of the court by ensuring that the laws are more than the personal whims and conceits of five unelected lawyers appointed for life yet in citizens united there is no evidence of special circumstances in the record that would justify overturning years of settled federal and state law the court appears to have mistaken its political desires for an emergency undermining stare decisis and its own legitimacy there are new statutory provisions that the congress and the texas legislature should pass to keep corporate and union funds out of our elections they could ban corporate campaign expenditures by any company that has substantial government contracts they could prohibit corporate political expenditures unless 23rds of all shareholders affirmatively approve they could outlaw corporate campaign contributions from all corporations that have foreign subsidiaries or significant foreign investors they could mandate that all state corporate charters or certificates to do business in their state proscribe corporate political expenditures to influence elections but the longterm answer to special interest domination of our democracy is developing stronger and broader civic and political participation in texas millions of our adult citizens are not civically engaged do not vote and are not informed in other states foundations businesses and individuals have attacked successfully their civic engagement deficits by focusing resources and energy on the problem for example investments in civic engagement of disengaged latinos have been made in new mexico and colorado and latino turnout has increased markedly in texas civic engagement and voting lags terribly especially among latinos in the 2008 presidential election according to the us census turnout of hispanic adult citizens in texas was just 378 percent which was less than the turnout in colorado 40 percent and new mexico 51 percent in the 2006 midterm elections turnout of adult hispanic citizens in harris county in 2008 was even worse only around 21 percent the only way the needs of regular texans will be addressed  as opposed to the special interest needs of the powerful  is for the public to become much better informed and more engaged to get educated organized and involved even an arrogant lawless supreme court cannot stop that juggernaut the us supreme court has ruled that prohibitions on corporatefunded mass media in federal elections are unconstitutional this ruling will almost certainly apply to like efforts by labor unions and lawyers and to the election of judges in 39 states whether we know it yet or not the supreme courts decision in citizens united v fec will come to be seen as the third horseman of the apocalypse for lawyers judges and those who favor the direct election of state judges standing alone citizens united does not necessarily condemn state judicial elections but it hardly stands alone in 2002 the supreme court decided republican party v white which like a first horseman heralded the beginning of the end of state judicial elections there the court found that judicial candidates enjoyed the same free speech rights as other office seekers meaning that special ethical prohibitions on how they campaign have fallen states can no longer stop judges from aligning with political parties declaring their position on a policy issue or directly soliciting campaign contributions from the lawyers or litigants who appear before them in casting the deciding fifth vote in white justice oconnor expressed her strong disfavor of the direct election of judges but noted that states choosing elections have to live with consequences of that choice those consequences are getting more severe with each new supreme court decision the white decision was hardly surprising the supreme court had rejected the argument that the administration of justice is somehow sacrosanct when it struck down rules banning lawyer advertising in 1977 but the ensuing onslaught of lawyer advertising on the sides of buses and telephone directories has done little to inspire public confidence in the organized bar or the legal process trashtalking judicial advertisements on tv and radio will yield the same caustic effect for the state judiciary and by extension state governments after white a case like the 2009 caperton v massey debacle our second horseman was inevitable in caperton a coal company faced a 50 million fraud judgment in west virginia acting in accord with the states election rules and human nature the companys ceo poured 3 million to the campaign of a candidate when that candidate was elected justice and sided with the coal company the us supreme court granted the case and ultimately decided that the federal due process clause prevents a judge from sitting when a person with a personal stake in the case had a significant and disproportionate influence in placing the judge on the bench no texas case has yet attempted to resolve the implications of white or caperton for the states judicial elections texas law limits the amount that any individual or political action committee can contribute to 5000 per election with 30000 cumulative per law firm and its lawyers and at the moment at least bars direct corporate giving still the money necessary to run an effective campaign has risen dramatically and the campaigns had already taken on a bruising quality before the supreme court decided that corporations trial lawyers and unions enjoy a constitutional right to run their own tv and radio advertisements meanwhile texas is now home to more fortune 500 companies than any other state and demographic change and increasing unionization efforts will make future judicial elections ground zero for the resulting conflicts to play themselves out the fourth horseman will be a case currently pending or soon to be filed in a texas state court somewhere the outcome will have huge consequences for one or both sides as they often do but this time one side will find 5000 too little support for a favorable judge or candidate why just try to buy a judge when you can destroy his opponent with an onslaught of direct tv ad buys and if one faction is doing it wont the others be forced to respond in kind this time when the survivor of this election takes the bench with the support of some corporate litigant or wealthy trial lawyer it wont just look like someone bought a judge or a favorable decision it will look like it in primetime and in full public view pulling the judiciary out of that ditch may be impossible or at least take generations meanwhile the voters are likely to assume that the whole government is rife with corruption or at least that the other departments are incompetent to devise a way to save the judiciary they wont know or care what the supreme court held in white or caperton or citizens united theyll just lose confidence in the rule of law and their government these recent supreme court decisions spell doom for judicial elections we should recognize it now and move to some form of meritbased selection for our judiciary while there is still some hope of retaining the publics confidence in what the founders designed to be the nonpolitical branch of government

Life of the Parties	2010-01-25	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2010/01/25/life-of-the-parties/	en	early voting in the party primaries starts in three weeks and the election is in five while there are nearly 200 legislative races on the ballot only a few are real contests heres a rundown of the ones worth watching were not taking a global view here  these are seats that are being fought over in the march 2 primary people who are in trouble in november have time to prepare the folks in trouble in the primary are in trouble right now its not a comprehensive list just because there are two people on the ballot doesnt mean theres a noteworthy battle brewing and its not a final list it will change several times in the next few weeks with new information new candidate actions and reactions and so on well publish an updated list as primary day approaches the toughest race on everyones list including ours hd11 state representative chuck hopson vs michael banks vs allan cain hopson a jacksonville legislator switched parties  to the republicans from the democrats  in the first week of november the republican powersthatbe in austin were generous in their support and praise of a move that after all firms up their tenuous hold on a nearly evenly split texas house but not everyone is on board hopson is running against two other republicans banks in particular is wellknown in jacksonville there are four counties in the district cherokee where jacksonville is houston rusk and panola hopsons in a primary hes never run in before all the democrats whove been helping him with phone banks and blockwalking are on the other team now hes got a conservative voting record but hes also voted with the democrats on lots of measures and voters arent fawning over incumbents at the moment democrats will have a hard time winning the district without hopson on their side of the ballot but some of them would love to see him lose just for switching and some republicans  within and outside the district  would rather have a republican legislator whos been a republican all along hopson carried the district by around 120 votes two years ago and is used to close races now hes got a new political team and everybodys attention the weirdest race sd22 state senator kip averitt vs darren yancy averitt filed for reelection and has a primary opponent and then announced  after it was too late for him to get off the ballot or for someone else to get on  that he doesnt want another term in the senate hes a moderate yancy is more conservative watch for yourself on youtube averitts from waco and yancy is from burleson  a distinction thats more important than party affiliation in some parts of sd22 waco would like to be the geographic center in the 10county district but if yancy wins itll move to johnson county no democrat filed in the race and if yancy wins hell face only a libertarian in november if averitt wins the republicans will get to pick a new candidate and because election laws say so the democrats will too averitt has talked to some supporters about resigning before the year is out  as opposed to serving out a term that ends next january if he does that there could be a special election on top of all this however it falls unless averitt has an unexpected change of heart there will be a new senator from central texas next year not really a race but congress conventional wisdom is that nobody in the congressional delegation is in real trouble conventional wisdom almost always sides with the incumbents though and its hard to calculate the electoral power of tea partiers and others angry at washington and entrenched establishmenttypes in both parties us representative chet edwards dwaco is perpetually at risk his is the most republican district in the country represented by a democratic congressman and ciro rodriguez dsan antonio is in a seat where voters generally like republicans more than democrats in statewide elections but those are general election worries the discontent among conservatives produced 11 contested gop primaries this year us representative ralph hall rrockwall drew five opponents but hes been in contested primaries since switching parties a couple of election cycles ago and has survived with relative ease nobody in congress from texas is on the march watch list at this point other incumbents at risk in their party primaries republicans hd83 representative delwin jones vs zach brady vs charles perry jones one of the 11 renegade republicans who toppled house speaker tom craddick in 2009 faces tough challenges

giovanni capriglione whether youre worried about this has something to do with where you are its high on the austin list if the conversation involves consultants and lobbyists and political financiers truitts folks are talking it down hd7 representative tommy merritt vs david simpson merritt draws opposition every time and has held them off so far every time simpson is the former mayor of avinger sd5 senator steve ogden vs ben bius the incumbent bryan republican faces businessman bius who has run unsuccessfully for other offices ogden brought this on himself saying last september he wouldnt be back bius got into the race as did representative dan gattis rgeorgetown gattis talked to ogden and got out of the race ogden got back in bius stayed ogdens got a race and the advantage hd4 representative betty brown vs lance gooden she used to be his boss hes running on time for a change  democrats hd100 representative terri hodge vs eric johnson hodges trial on public corruption charges starts just days after the primary so johnsons got something to talk about hes also a harvardprincetonpenntrained attorney with his own practice hes organized and raising lots of money other dallas democratic officeholders  at least at the state level  are sticking with hodge but johnson is getting some support from locals advantage the challenger hd146 representative al edwards vs borris miles edwards lost to miles in 2006 and then won the seat back in 2008 the third times just charming hd43 representative tara rios ybarra vs jose manuel lozano the first race for reelection is the hardest rios ybarra a dentist from south padre island who defeated incumbent juan escobar in 2008 has a tough wellfinanced opponent she has a messy divorce case thats made headlines and that might be behind her depending on whether her opponent wants to stir the pot but she also has the backing of texans for lawsuit reform and others who helped her win last time primaries getting attention because the winners will challenge targeted incumbents in the fall hd47 david sewell vs holly white turner vs paul workman the winner will face representative valinda bolton daustin in a district where voters like statewide republicans bolton held off a stiff challenge two years ago and the republicans are hoping as in other districts that some of her strength came from a democratic surge in 2008 that wont be there they hope in 2010 hd52 stephen casey vs alyssa eacono vs larry gonzales vs john gordon the figuring is the same as in the bolton race with this difference representative diana maldonado dround rock is in her first defense of the seat and hasnt been battlehardened by tough reelection contests gonzales and gordon appear to be in front of the pack hd78 luis rene diaz vs robert kleberg vs dee margo the winner will face representative joe moody del paso in what was for years a republican seat in the texas legislature jack vowell held it followed by pat haggerty margo lost to moody last time kleberg and diaz are new to this hd101 greg noschese vs cindy burkett vs thomas latham start at the back of the alphabet latham a former state representative lost a primary challenge in 2008 to the guy who then lost to robert miklos now the democratic incumbent burkett owns subway franchises and is making her first run noschese was a mesquite city councilman miklos is running for reelection for the first time and the republicans want to see if he was a fluke winning in a district that belonged to the gop for years hd105 kim limberg vs loretta haldenwang the winner will face representative linda harperbrown rirving who had the narrowest margin of victory of anyone in the legislature on the 2008 ballot less than two dozen votes open seats where the incumbents have opted

Primary Races Tend to Be Bloody	2009-11-03	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2009/11/03/primary-races-tend-to-be-bloody/	en	ask a republican whos not on governor rick perry or senator kay bailey hutchisons payroll about the 2010 governors primary and youll get a response about a welltimed trip to palm springs in early march when the two candidates square off party faithful want to stay above the fray primary challenges to longstanding incumbents tend to get rough quick the last time a sitting governor faced a serious primary challenge the gop unlocked the door to the governors mansion for the first time since reconstruction after john hill upset twoterm governor dolph briscoe in the democratic primary republican bill clements carried the general election that was in 1978 the briscoehill showdown provided an excuse for disgruntled briscoe supporters  conservative democrats already bristling within their party  to decamp for the gop it also crystallized the change that had been brewing for the past decade texas migration from a oneparty to a twoparty state former state senator je buster brown rlake jackson who left office in 2002 as the senior ranking republican member said the movement to a twoparty state set the stage for increasingly bitter primary fights in both parties in the original politics of texas when you had a battle in the primary it was generally philosophical brown said you had the liberal segment of the party and the conservative segment but they were democrats and when the primary was over they remained democrats because it was a oneparty state  brown a democrat for clements after briscoes defeat entered the senate a newly minted republican in 1981 he unseated democratic incumbent babe schwartz of galveston who he described as a liberal and proud of it  according to brown their ideological differences allowed for a great race on the issues  but when thenhouse republican bill blythe challenged him in a primary a year later brown said the tenor of the campaign changed as brown put it because blythe had few core issues on which to distinguish himself his campaign got personaland tried to cast brown as either a crook or an atheist to repel voters though it didnt involve an incumbent the 1990 democratic primary runoff for the governors seat between namebrand candidates ann richards then state treasurer and jim mattox then attorney general is a touchstone in the annals of ugly primary contests the pair who held nearly identical positions on the issues had run together on a democratic ticket in 1982 and 1986 but past alliances didnt stop mattox from circulating rumors that richards a recovering alcoholic used marijuana or something worse like cocaine not as a college kid but as a 47yearold elected official sworn to uphold the law in television spots in races like the richardsmattox primary brown said candidates feel pressure from political consultants to shift strategy from substantive debate to lets check their high school records lets look at their marital records lets see if we can get a copy of their divorce  carlos urestis campaign might not have gotten a peek at frank madlas sophomoreyear trigonometry grades when he challenged the decadelong incumbent for his state senate seat in 2006 but it did accelerate a widely acknowledged feud between the madla uresti and rodriguez political families over who controlled san antonios southside though uresti jabbed madla for his coziness to republicans in austin bexar county democratic party chairwoman carla vela said issues took a backseat to the intraparty power struggle it was just like the hatfields and mccoys of the southside of san antonio she said that was really what it was all aboutwho is really the powerhouse in southside san antonio  two more bexar county races show republicans arent above primary melees if circumstances are ripe in 2000 elizabeth ames jones until then a political unknown from alamo heights ousted bill siebert from the seat he had held since 1993 after his ongoing work as a lobbyist was spotlighted by hometown news outlets a san antonio expressnews editorial went as far as calling on primary voters to clean house and dump state representative bill siebert the local gops biggest embarrassment  in 2002 san antonio republican jeff wentworth fended off a cashflush challenger in john shields whom conservative political action committee freepac backed with mailings detailing wentworths progay proassisted suicide and proabortion politics though shields publicly denied involvement with the mailings his campaign literature featured a quote from pastor john hagee calling wentworth the most proabortion legislator in austin wentworth retaliated with a complaint in the expressnews about shields highprofile fatherinlaw i think the race is getting to be about red mccombs and his effort to buy his son sic a state senate seat  amid a push by liberal democrats in 2006 to unseat socalled craddick ds  democrats who crossed party lines to support republican tom craddick for speaker of the house in 2003  character issues lent a hand to challengers who landed knockout blows state representative al edwards of houston who had represented hd146 since 1978 proved unable to deflect attacks from challenger borris miles that he had grown too chummy with republican leadership among democrats grievances against edwards were his support of gop house speaker craddick and his decision to stay put as many of his partys legislators left for ardmore okla in protest of republican redistricting in 2003 but miles supporters also turned the race into a referendum on a civil rights leader who had lost his gravitas edwards became a national punchline in 2005 when he crusaded against what he called the epidemic of sexy cheerleading  edwards returned in 2008 to beat miles handily after reports surfaced about miles bizarre behavior with a handgun at a holiday party and older black voters questioned his support of a controversial school bond issue perhaps the best indicator of how unpleasant primary challenges can get is the reluctance of some political officials to discuss them though texas gop chairwomanelect cathie adams admits shes seen the darker side of republican primary fights she professed a case of selfinduced memory loss when asked for examples of specific races i try and forget them as soon as i can because they are so wrong adams said i dont like personal attacks at all and i dont think theres a need in doing that i think more than anything it makes the person dishing it out look bad  adams did say that she defers to the electorate when it comes to intraparty challenges and thinks theyre a plus for the party if conducted fairly but according to austin lobbyist bob strauser key party contributors usually feel differently i think the people who feel an ownership in the party would prefer almost any result other than a contested primary because it may upset the apple cart it may hurt them in november who knows  vela said she prefers it when upandcoming politicians dont seek out bruising contests against democratic incumbents were all democrats and we should all stick together she said im not thrilled when somebody that wants to make a name for themselves whos new into politics takes on an good incumbent  in fact vela said her fellow democrats should take a lesson from their rival party who despite a few notable primary slapfights enjoy a reputation for their aversion to public airings of tribal conflict i tell people why dont you pay attention to the republicans  they dont go after their own if theres a good incumbent sitting there  texas tribune donors or members may be quoted or mentioned in our stories or may

Third Time's the Charm	2009-08-24	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2009/08/24/third-times-the-charm/	en	after exploratory dry runs in 2002 and 2006 us senator kay bailey hutchison formally announced her bid for governor of texas before a sparse crowd in la marque starting a 19stop weeklong tour of the state with a series of broadsides at the incumbent and a promise to return the state to republican glory under republican governor rick perry she said the state has the highest property taxes in the us state debt has doubled college tuition is skyrocketing dropout rates are high the number of uninsured children is high and private property rights are at risk she said texas unemployment outstrips the region and that more people lost jobs here last month than in any other state but california she said shell address those problems but offered few specifics hutchison said her focus will be on five areas fiscal policy education transportation health care and government reform she said prek and two years of college should be part of the states basic education package shed increase the size of the states transportation board and end anything that resembles perrys transtexas corridor she said she would try to build a health care system that is the exact opposite of what is proposed in congress today  and she said governors of texas should be subject to term limits  a jab at an incumbent who is seeking four more years after ten in office she offered one of those political lineinthesand promises that could make or break her later if she wins this time i will spend less tax less and borrow less  she closed with a promise to rebuild the republican party in texas  she cited losses of seats in the texas house as evidence of decay  and then a call for improvement of the state we can do better  you can listen to the speech here and look here for a written copy of her prepared remarks the actual delivery varies but not in a significant way some of the senators lines are flat or easy for perry to lob back she and he were elected to state office the same year and shes been in the senate for seven more years than hes been governor its hard to land a blow for term limits or time on task but thats a key component of her pitch to voters the red meat is hard to find in a speech that sounds more like a general election argument than one aimed at republican primary voters high state property taxes and rising spending are in there but perrys magic word is washington and it bounces those issues back at her theyre also perennial themes that previous perry opponents have tried unsuccessfully to tag him with uninsured kids high dropout rates skyrocketing tuition and the transtexas corridor here for instance is carole keeton strayhorn from four years and two months ago stating her case against the guv it is time for a change it is time to send governor perry packin i am a fiscal conservative i am a common sense conservative i am not a weak leadin ethics ignorin pointin the finger at everyone blamin special session callin public school slashin slush fund spendin toll road buildin special interest panderin rainy day fund raidin fee increasin no property tax cuttin promise breakin donothin rick perry phony conservative  you get the idea hutchison says the states citizens dont have it good enough but hasnt added policy proposals or ideas to her sales routine ever had a car dealer take you outside and walk you around the car you drove in pointing out all the dings to lower your expectations on the tradein thats always done after theyve sold you on the new car hutchison is talking about the old car and hasnt unveiled the new one yet its an unusual approach its not all messaging one oldschool rule dont roll out a campaign in august wait until after labor day after the squirts are in school and football has begun and vacation season is over and its not so bleeping hot hutchisons crowds were roughly the same size and enthusiasm you see when people announce for mayor political folk keep making comparisons with the 1990 race and its toughfought democratic primary but those candidates  jim mattox ann richards and mark white  werent doing announcement tours in the august before the primary and it was vaguely unusual that richards went on a weeklong environmental tour of the texas coast with reporters tagging along before labor day rolled around that press corps isnt as big as it was hutchisons troops offered the press a ride on any leg of the fiveday tour they got three takers the dallas morning news the austin americanstatesman and the associated press and only for a day sometimes oldschool just wont work hutchison foreshadowed her opening week as a candidate with a video that skipped new policy ideas instead touting her own strengths and setting up a line of attack on incumbent rick perry hutchison popped up a web video a day before starting a 19city announcement tour of the state her ad quotes perry calling her a true champion for texas and saying she led the charge against the state income tax and without proposing any policies says shell be an education reformer and will put an end to toll road land grabs  it doesnt name perry except when it quotes him saying nice things about hutchison back in the day but it slams the state of the state on his watch starting with the line its time for a government worthy of its people again  it refers to grandstanding in austin says texas is losing jobs faster than other states that dropout rates are out of control and that property taxes are higher here than anywhere else in the country it also raps perrys promotion of a vaccine against cervical cancer two years ago saying the governor shouldnt wedge the state between you and your family  see for yourself    tom pauken isnt running for us senate but he says he might be interested in the job if kay bailey hutchison steps down and nobody from his part of the gop gets into the race ive gotten increasingly frustrated we had a strong reagan majority and weve squandered that capital he says pauken a former texas gop chairman who currently heads the texas workforce commission aims his criticism at republicans in federal office and is particularly focused on dallas mayor tom leppert a republican whos been mentioned as a candidate and who in paukens view isnt a true conservative and the twc chairman let the folks in the pink building know hes thinking about becoming a candidate but pauken hasnt pulled the trigger im not interested in a kamikaze race he says senator kirk watson daustin will seek reelection next year that news in a weekly email to supporters takes him out of the conversation about democratic candidates for governor and that in turn is a huge relief to fort worth bidnessmanlawyer tom schieffer schieffer is already running as a democrat and it didnt help his effort to have a competitor out there causing the money people to hesitate now if they hesitate it wont be watsons fault in his email watson said he wants to have time to spend with his youngest son whos just entering high school and four years as governor would get in the way of that he doesnt lack for confidence though despite those reasons this has been a very tough decision its hard in part because i believe i would win the race for governor  schieffer in a statement sounded happy i welcome senator watsons statement today he would have been a formidable opponent in the democratic primary  schieffers the only announced candidate on the democratic side of that race kinky friedman who ran as an independent in 2006 is also considering a run as a democrat despite their sprawling districts and power over public school curricula state board of education members can often coast through election season with little opposition and money spent that isnt the outlook for 2010 widely publicized actions by the sboe concerning math textbooks science education and social studies have engendered a lot of controversy over the past couple of years it has grabbed peoples attention the more coverage the better i think this is awesome says former board chair don mcleroy rbryan challengers  including the son of former lieutenant governor bill ratliff  have popped up for four of the eight incumbent members up for reelection next year just one victory by a challenger would shift the ideological balance of the 15member board which is composed of 10 republicans and five democrats typically board members split into two sides  seven social conservatives vs seven notasconservatives  with democrat rick agosto of san antonio operating as the swing voter who picks which end of the teetertotter goes up or down a trio from the social conservative group has already attracted challengers months before the january filing deadline mcleroy and cynthia dunbar of richmond face opposition in the gop primary and ken mercer of san antonio is looking at a general election contest a member of the notasconservative group geraldine tincy miller rdallas also has an opponent james southward george clayton of richardson but hes done little more  at least publicly  than set up a campaign account miller does intend to run for reelection says alexis delee who was the spokeswoman for thenhouse speaker tom craddick and is now working as a consultant for miller all of the challengers we spoke to we didnt reach clayton put themselves in the notasconservative group which would hold an outright majority of the board if even one of them defeats an incumbent their estimates of how much money it will take to mount a serious campaign range from 100000 to 250000 district 9 mcleroys district stretches from paris to bryan including part of plano and dallas eastern suburbs in 2006 mcleroy spent about 8000 to defeat democrat maggie charleton 60 to 40 percent according to the texas legislative council governor rick perry drew 45 percent of the districts vote in the fourhorse gubernatorial campaign outdoing his statewide take of 39 percent democrat chris bell got 24 percent of the votes in that district that year while getting 30 percent statewide voters may recognize mcleroys new opponent thomas ratliff of mt pleasant as the son of the former lite guv a lobbyist the younger ratliff says he wants to give more control of schools to local districts while he calls himself deeply religious ratliff says constantly pushing religion in the classroom provides the constant threat of lawsuits when you start blurring the lines you put schools at risk  not only does mcleroy defend his record on the board he intends to highlight it saying that he is following through on campaign promises hes been making since 1998 i am so excited excited to have an opponent who has good connections hopefully well be able to get the discussion going im going to run a superpositive campaign i have so much to talk about mcleroy says this is cool i may not win  i imagine thomas ratliff is a good politician like his dad but i cant think of a better opportunity than to have the wellknown son of a wellknown texas politician running against me  in july ratliff reported having 3650 in the bank thats 3650 more than mcleroy had district 10 dunbars district includes northern travis county williamson county cuero and down to the southwestern houston suburbs in 2006 dunbar spent about 45000 to beat tony dale in the gop primary 64 to 36 percent she spent almost nothing to defeat a libertarian opponent in the general 70 to 30 percent in the general perry inched out democrat chris bell 36 to 34 percent in the district dunbar has one declared opponent in the gop primary round rock schoolteacher rebecca osborne theres a disconnect between the state board of education and the classroom osborne says osborne says shes not an abd anyone but dunbar candidate she says i am not running as a reaction to cynthia dunbar i am running because i believe there are things that i can do because of my own qualifications my agenda would simply be different from cynthia dunbars  another republican julie cowan of austin is still in the exploratory phase one consideration weighing on cowans mind is whether her candidacy might split the vote with osborne and allow dunbar to win i dont need to be the one to run but there needs to be someone to run cowan says cynthia dunbar isnt doing it for me  additionally two democrats have opened campaign accounts for the race austinite judith jennings who formerly worked for the texas education agency and now works for resources for learning educational company reported 8500 cash on hand in july neither dunbar nor osborne reported having much on hand university of texas prof lorenzo sadun of austin raised about 1200 and had about 3800 on hand including loans in 2004 sadun ran a writein candidacy as a democrat for us congress against michael mccaul he only drew six percent of the vote that was a protest candidacy he says claiming the whomping demonstrates his ability to raise money  about 33000 in all during that election sadun points out that the district split almost evenly 5048 between john mccain and barack obama in the 2008 elections that means this is a district where if people become aware of just how extreme cynthia dunbar is im expecting moderate republicans to vote democratic and for it to be a solid democratic win he says district 5 mercers district starts on the north side of san antonio stretches west to harper and as far north as killeen and includes the south side of austin in 2006 perry won 39 percent of the vote in the gop primary and runoff that year mercer a former representative spent about 50000 to defeat incumbent sboe member dan montgomery mercer reported having 26313 in the bank this july unless another republican surfaces he will face the winner of the 2010 democratic primary texas state university prof rebecca bellmetereau filed for that race last week so there are no money figures to look at yet but her campaign treasurer is teresa hobby who is the daughterinlaw of former lieutenant governor bill hobby bellmetereau says she wants to take partisanship out of curriculum decisions we need to have texas get in line with the national curriculum it shouldnt be that were this weird little ghetto that cant handle the kind of information and level of sophistication that you see in curricula around the country and im afraid thats whats happening we have people who think critical thinking is gobbledygook bellmetereau says also in the race is daniel boone who lost by about 44 percentage points in 2008 to representative doug miller rnew braunfels other candidates are james rath whose campaign website is a portal to an actblue fundraising page and josiah ingalls who received less than one percent of the vote in the may 2009 austin mayoral election finishing last in a field of five that also included former texas comptroller carole keeton strayhorn who finished third the other board members up for reelection in 2010 are agosto lawrence allen jr dhouston bob craig rlubbock and rene nuez del paso looking ahead to 2012 one democratic sboe member is already saying that shes not going to run again corpus christis mary helen berlanga whose tenure since 1982 makes her the senior member of the board says i think it will be time for someone else to get involved and dedicate some time to the state and to schoolchildren  its quite critical during any election that we look for individuals who are fairminded openminded and have the interest of the children at heart and really believe in public education berlanga says we have some individuals on the board who are not interested in public education and have said so openly  by a texas weekly

And They're Off!	2009-01-19	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2009/01/19/and-theyre-off/	en	the house elected a new speaker the senate started with a partisan dogfight the comptroller filed a gloomy forecast on the states revenue for the next two years the republican candidates for governor  thats an election more than a year away  revealed multimilliondollar bank balances once all that had rolled out lawmakers left for a week the house will return next week for a day then do rules the week after that and the senate is gone until january 26 soon enough itll seem like they never left candidate and committee reports due this week are popping up on line news so far  governor rick perry reached the end of 2008 with 66 million in hand raising 47 million in the second half of the year  us senator kay bailey hutchisons exploratory committee will have enough money to chart antarctica if they want to she moved 8 million 1 million first then 7 million more from her federal account to her state account thats probably a oneway street she cant move it back  the rules are different  without some serious lawyering hutchisons detailed report isnt available yet her actual fundraising was skimpy just over 30000 perry himself ducked the chance to comment on the finances saying his attention is on the legislative session and suggesting the federal government thatd be the senator see could help the state out by working on immigration and border security and such his spokesman mark miner provided the towelsnap on finance its clear her campaign is already faltering when they have to use their federal campaign dollars to bailout their dismal state efforts its just like a washington politician to use money intended for one purpose and spend it on another  hutchison is still in exploratory mode but shes inching toward a commitment today as we file the first campaign finance report for the committee we are starting fundraising in earnest and making a major step toward a campaign for governor she said in a press release in the coming weeks i will be taking additional steps toward a race for governor this is a critical time for our state and nation i am going to be traveling our state talking to texans from all walks of life and working hard to make certain that the wisdom and opinion of people across our state is heard  perry says flatly that hes in the race for another term after his current one  comptroller susan combs starts the 2010 cycle with 36 million in the bank and has said she plans to stay where she is if voters approve she raised 1 million in the last half of 2008  attorney general greg abbott ended the year with 86 million in the bank  more than either hutchison or perry he was coasting though raising 582514 and spending 318994 abbott has feinted at a run for us senate should hutchison step aside for the governors race his state money is incompatible with federal finance laws and hed have to start all over again hes also got his eye on the lieutenant governor job should david dewhurst run for something else  what of dewhurst hes been paying down his loan balances now at 13 million dewhurst raised 31 million during the second half of the year spent all of it and ended the period with 759856 hes generally suspected of wanting hutchisons spot  since the race for governor is crowded  and could selffinance all or part of a federal race giving him a leg up  deposed house speaker tom craddick rmidland ended the year with 21 million after bringing in 314987 and spending 511390 during the last two months of the year his report since he was on the ballot in 2008 covers everything since his last report filed in october  craddicks successor house speaker joe straus ended the year with 647966 raising 50650 since his october report and spending 26562 interesting tidbit straus mom recently showed up on a fundraising notice for hutchison shes pulled out of that now that her son is speaker straus himself reported a midnovember contribution of 1000 to texans for rick perry representative joe straus iii rsan antonio is officially the speaker of the texas house straus was elected by acclamation after six nominating speeches on a day marked by ceremony crowds of families and friends and the start of another legislative session he was sworn in by a fellow san antonian texas supreme court chief justice wallace jefferson at a house session presided over by another secretary of state hope andrade he gave a short speech saying the biblical line invoked by houston and by lincoln applied here a house divided against itself cannot stand  and he ended on a similar note let there be no walls in this house  the house will do rules within the next two weeks or so straus will assign committees and theyll be off to the races early next month the senate meantime made robert duncan rlubbock the president pro tempore that bodys expected to organize more quickly since it has only two new members and no management and staff overhaul in process and the senate revved up an old fight over its twothirds rule that body wont take up legislation unless twothirds of the people in the room agree democrats have just enough members to block partisan bills and some republicans led by senator dan patrick rhouston want to get rid of the rule or lower the requirement to say 60 percent more on that in a minute notes from the opening representative senfronia thompson dhouston on straus nomination by a group of eleven republicans i wasnt surprised i was shocked  representative jim mcreynolds dlufkin in his nominating speech in this 140day session policy should transcend politics  representative veronica gonzales dmcallen in hers with the numbers of republicans and democrats so close i take comfort in knowing that bills will live or die based on their merit and not on a partisan basis  representative burt solomons rcarrollton will oversee changes in the house rules among the things in that grabbag how many committees the house will have and how many people will be on each of them governor rick perry ended the first day with a rhetorical flourish the first day of a session is a beautiful thing  its like a blank canvass heres hoping we paint a masterpiece  one last note we originally filed this from the house on the public wireless system that was put in and activated in the last week for several years up to now the house has been one of the few wififree zones in the state capitol due to technical problems  on their second day in town texas senators stepped into the first partisan fight of the new session with republicans successfully carving out an exception to rules that govern how many senators it takes to consider legislation the upper chamber has a rule barring consideration of bills that are objectionable to more than a third of the senators and with 12 democrats among the 31 senators there are enough votes to block consideration of partisan bills but senators voted 1813 in favor of an exception voter id legislation wont require the twothirds vote required for other issues republicans led by lieutenant governor david dewhurst want to pass a voter id bill  one that requires voters to show a photo identification before theyre allowed to vote republicans say thats a security measure against voter fraud democrats say it suppresses votes disproportionately hurting their side more than the gop side and the only way to bring the legislation to the floor  with the democrats in opposition  is to change the rules the debate echoed the arguments over redistricting that sent 11 democratic senators packing to new mexico several years ago where they denied the senate a quorum by leaving the state that incident  like a previous one that saw house democrats decamping to ardmore oklahoma  ignited a call within the gop for an end to the twothirds rule voter id is the issue of the day redistricting  up for consideration every decade  will be the issue in its place in two years the senate spent its first two days in austin working on that battle with republicans  senator tommy williams rthe woodlands suggesting the twothirds rule should have an exception for partisan issues in general and as the battle went on for the voter id bill in particular every preliminary vote along the way had the same result 19 republicans to 12 democrats senators did much of the negotiating and debate  as is their custom  behind closed doors thus the headline above they came out at one point and actually did some debating in public with republicans proposing an exception for voter id the democrats proposed several amendments forcing republicans to vote against amendments that would have substituted the voter id exception with other issues like insurance reform higher veterans benefits job programs public school finance college tuition rollbacks and the childrens health insurance program they disappeared again for several hours emerging with a proposal to send the voter id bill to a committee of the whole  thats the whole senate at once  so that everyone can debate there before the bill comes to the floor but it could come to the floor with a simple majority vote  and without the twothirds support required for other legislation senator john carona rdallas told senators he favors the voter id bill but didnt want to change the senate rules he was the lone republican voting against the change williams argued that this is a onetime thing on an issue of bipartisan concern that wont necessarily lead to other exceptions but senator dan patrick rhouston is hoping this is the first step in undoing the twothirds rule he has argued for years that its undemocratic and that the senate should do away with it or at least lower it to 60 percent either option would give the republican majority a final say in any partisan issues before the senate senator john whitmire dhouston said the voter id episode will lead to more exceptions and said senators were drawing a road map for outside partisans and political consultants who want to pressure the senate to vote on other emotional issues  so why the first day because you can change the rules on the first day with a simple majority wait until later in the session and you have to have a twothirds vote to bring it up the democrats cant block it now but could have done so later while they were debating  a court in georgia said that states voter id bill is legal the new numbers from the comptroller arent all that bleak to tell the truth but if you read the report that came with them youll rush out and buy an umbrella and some galoshes comptroller susan combs says the state legislature will start with 771 billion available for general revenue spending in the 20102011 biennium thats down more than 10 percent from what was available to the budgeteers two years ago and put the first asterisk here combs new biennial revenue estimate also comes with the biggest balance ever reached in the states rainy day fund  enough to nearly cover the difference between this years estimate and the one combs made two years ago at the end of the biennium that fund is expected to have a balance of 91 billion put it another way if they can get twothirds of the lege to go along they can use that money for general spending the lower numbers are based on two things mainly lawmakers start with a cash balance of about 21 billion as against 9 billion two years ago secondly combs and her forecasters appear to have adopted negative assumptions about the economy wherever they had the choice they could well be right but any mistakes theyve made will bring relief  more money  rather than grief it would be hard for the state to do worse than shes predicting financially it could do better adding money to the pot the comptroller expects actual general revenue  not counting that starting cash balance  to drop by 22 billion to 75 billion general revenue is what they call nondedicated state funds in the 167 billion budget and shes expecting the texas economy to share the national economys troubles  if later and to a lesser extent our new economic forecast indicates texas will be affected in fiscal 2009 before regaining economic momentum in 2010  theyre predicting texas will lose 111000 nonfarm jobs between now and midsummer before starting to add jobs again in the fourth quarter of the year in fiscal 2009 theyre forecasting gross state product will increase by 18 percent then by 19 percent in 2010 and 38 percent in 2011 the states biggest revenueproducer  the sales tax  is expected to rise but more slowly combs expects a drop in income from several other taxes including the natural gas tax the insurance tax motor vehicle sales and rentals and oil production and regulation taxes the state franchise tax she says will be flat over the next few years this is an example of a place where shes taking the dimmest possible view a onetime break cut the franchise tax revenues in its first and only year of collection by hundreds of millions of dollars but in her projection for the second and third years of that tax combs didnt add those numbers back in that might turn out to be right but its another place where a little light could shine and the numbers would grow that said its clear the tax isnt producing what the comptroller and her predecessor predicted when that tax was revised in 2006 the comptroller said it would produce almost 6 billion a year in fact its producing only about 44 billion annually that puts some pressure on budgeteers the state is obligated to spend about 142 billion every two years to fulfill a promise to offset cuts in local school property taxes that was the deal in 2006 cut local property taxes replace the money lost with state funds but the property tax fund doesnt cover that nut the 142 billion cost stacks up against a fund thats projected to have 85 billion this biennium lawmakers will have to make up the difference out of general revenue combs expects the texas lotterys numbers to slide about three percent the whole bre is  available online with charts and tables galore read the executive summary up front  youll see what we mean about the bad weather gear governor rick perry is doing his biennial rounds of pregame interviews on the legislative session hell outline his plans and hopes in his state of the state speech in a couple of weeks and isnt spilling now so we asked him about being in office long enough to name all of the appointees in all of the agencies as well as dozens of top state employees throughout the executive branch about his 24 years in government and why he wants six more the rest of this term and another one his short and mediumterm plans the changes or not in the states politics and the fate of rural texas in an increasingly urban and suburban state he never talked about us senator kay bailey hutchison by name but prick your ears youll find campaign themes sprinkled throughout his comments a transcript of the full interview is available online perry has been in office longer than any of his predecessors  long enough to fill all of the appointed jobs the terms of which are staggered over six years time and hes touting that control and his experience as reasons to keep him in place it is one of the reasons that i think we have had the successes over the course of the last five years that weve had in this state due not all but in part to having people who are philosophically all on the same page of the hymnbook theres a real philosophical imprint on state government today that george bush and rick perry together  and obviously all the appointees now that ive made he said  from time to time we dont necessarily agree that the result was the one i was looking for but in the vast vast majority of the times we do  hes a fan of publicprivate partnerships and hints at proposals along those lines in higher education he defended the hpv vaccine he proposed last session and said the idea was consistent with his prolife politics perry touted his experience comparing his knowledge of state government and his resume on the state level to a texas presidents national and international resume there have been very few if any people who have been trained as well as i have to be governor he said thats just factual you know appropriations state agency lieutenant governor governor small businessman before that kind of gets it about public service not unlike george hw bush theres a man who was very well prepared to be the president of the united states from the standpoint of different life experiences where he really had a broad grasp of the world and congress and international affairs and i think history will show that he was a pretty darn good president  his focus during the session will be on the state budget and after that on running the state and running for office so in the next 138 days its pretty simple particularly since last september and the financial meltdown its managing this states budget  prioritizing whats important  and keeping texas on track i dont get confused that just because the legislature leaves town theres still not a very big state to manage i get the added interesting aspect of a possible primary election and a general election but im up to it i can multitask ive done it before  the governor said texas remains a rightofcenter state but said the gop needs to mend its image with hispanics for instance i think that the tancredo guy and his very antianybodythatdontlooklikeme rhetoric has not been particularly good perry said but hes hopeful that theyre in sync with him the hispanic population is growing and theyre prolife profamily probusiness propatriot promilitary if you will and progod profaith those are people that are philosophically pretty attuned to me  if lawmakers were to do redistricting this year based on mid2007 estimates from the census bureau the latest available the average house district would have about 20000 more people in it than in 2000 and the migration of political power from rural areas to populated areas  especially suburbs  would be particularly painful for rural texas do the math to see which counties would gain seats in that hypothetical drawing and collin denton fort bend williamson and montgomery counties rise to the top each  depending on rounding and whether and how districts cross county line  would gain a seat in the texas house most of the losses would be spread across rural texas for the most part those multicounty districts would have to grow in geographic size diluting local interests to keep up with the numbers but some losers are clear dallas county would lose a seat and el paso and jefferson counties would lose some clout too you dont have to lose population to lose power in this arithmetic growing more slowly than the rest of the state is enough to do the damage the trend is similar but less clear in the state senate where districts are bigger and the chance of a county getting a whole new senate seat are small the size of the average district would jump to 771109 from 672638 if the 2007 estimates were used thats 98470 more people in each senators district and rural district lines will have to be stretched to find sufficient population at the time theyre drawn districts have to be equal in size congressional seats work a little differently if texas gains three seats were growing while other states grow less quickly or shrink one will probably go in the collindenton county area another would probably go to the vicinity of harrisfort bend counties rural congressional districts in texas would get bigger geographically to make up for lost population tarrant and bexar counties probably wouldnt get entire new seats but their increases might ensure that seats they share with others were dominated by those urban centers same with travis and williamson counties which are adjacent huge areas of texas  118 of 254 counties  lost population between the 2000 census and mid2007 according to the census bureaus estimates only 31 of the states counties grew faster than the state as a whole and they tended to be larger counties only four of the states 15 biggest counties missed that growth mark and one of them  bexar county  only missed by a tenth of a percent those counties will be first in line to gain seats since they grew the most on both a percentage and raw number basis only five of the 50 largest counties lost population although 28 of that top 50 grew more slowly than the state as a whole this is early and highly speculative the trends are clear but the specifics will change when the real 2010 census numbers are in and when the real political work is done on redistricting  when creative people bend the demographic facts to their advantage or try to speakerapparent joe straus named former representative clyde alexander will be his chief of staff alexander who served as a democrat from athens now lives in san antonio and is friends with the new speaker hes been involved in the

Going for Three	2008-04-21	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2008/04/21/going-for-three/	en	governor rick perry talking to reporters from the dallas morning news and the fort worth startelegram became the first candidate to say  without reservations  that hell be on the gubernatorial ballot in 2010 the pronouncement could dirty some diapers in the political nursery us senator kay bailey hutchison has professed some interest in the job but hasnt said for certain whether shell seek the job and lieutenant governor david dewhurst includes it on his list of possibles a list that could include a reelection bid a bid for governor or a bid for us senate depending on whats open when hes ready to decide his next move democrats who get mentioned for the 2010 race include houston mayor bill white former texas tech chancellor john montford and former comptroller john sharp theres plenty of time for speculation the filing deadline is in january 2010  more than 20 months from now the austin americanstatesman caught hutchison in washington and put a tape of that conversation on their website i am very encouraged by people asking me to come home and run for governor to provide leadership for texas hutchison told that paper i just think its too early to make a decision like that because im working very hard for candidates this cycle and i dont want to do something thats unfair to them so it is a decision that i will make at the appropriate time  dewhurst said hell decide later whats next in his political career my focus is on the 2009 legislative session and continuing to build on our successes over the past five years he said whatever i decide to do after that will be based on whats best for texas  until now perry has been hinting at another race saying hell run again if he doesnt finish the things he thinks need to be completed hes been vague about whats on that list his comments to the dallas paper later confirmed by an aide were he first time he or anyone else has flatly declared a candidacy texas governors have been elected three times before but not since terms were lengthened to four years from two by the time those 2010 elections roll around perry will already be the longestserving governor in state history hell pass bill clements eightyear record early next year he took office after george w bush was elected president and then won elections in 2002 and 2006 another term would give him up to 14 years in the governors mansion what does it mean that governor rick perry will seek another term it puts him back in charge of the conversation kay bailey hutchison has been talking to supporters and potential supporters for months about a race for governor with the conventional assumption that itll be an open seat in 2010 now that perrys weighed in the finance people in the gop cant support hutchison without first spurning perry even if theyre predisposed to that its a risky action to take against a sitting governor in your own party hutchison and to a lesser extent lieutenant governor david dewhurst have been openly eyeing the job without committing to a run one common line of conversation in political circles was that if either of the two would simply say they were running everyone elses hand would be forced in a political game of dare ya  hutchison talked to potential backers in 2002 and 2006 and decided not to run against perry each time that speculation moving attention from the present to the future weakens the incumbents hold on the office perry the present and now  because of his declaration  the future is back in control it dampens the speculation about whos doing what in the next election cycle the endless games of musical political chairs hinge on an open seat somewhere near the top of the ballot they go like this if perry doesnt run this person will run for governor and then their position will open up and then other positions will open as each officeholder sees a higher rung to grab and so on hutchison and dewhurst havent said theyre going anywhere for sure and perrys staying wheres the open seat it makes it more difficult for ambitious republicans to plan their next fights they cant talk widely about their plans without offending current officeholders everybodys got to wait a bit democrats have been playing musical chairs too trying to figure out what statewide seats might be open and which incumbents might be vulnerable if they try to stay and those who want to be governor have a new thing to ponder perry only got 39 percent in the last election against three challengers is he beatable hell have been governor for ten years if he runs again will people want more if he succeeded in killing lame duck speculation perry might have accomplished something else moving the 2010 election out of 2008 where the speculation has threatened to swamp a lackluster political fight card and into 2009 where it can compete with the legislature for attention subtract representative todd smith from the group working to replace house speaker tom craddick with another republican the euless republican reads the primary and runoff election results to mean no other republican will be elected in craddicks place next year it is simply a reaction to the facts on the ground says smith whos been a critic of the speaker regularly counted among the abc  anybody but craddick  vote in the house everybody knows ive supported candidates his candidates won in those races and my candidates lost in those races the facts changed and i am reacting to the facts i no longer see a scenario where we get a republican speaker who is not craddick smith says he thinks theres a chance the democrats will take the house in november and elect a speaker of their own the republicans currently outnumber democrats by eight in the house and five democratic victories would change the majority but after congenial conversations with former representative terral smith whos now craddicks chief of staff and with craddick himself todd smith is playing to get along he says he hasnt signed a pledge to vote for another term for craddick that he still wants a change in the rules and that im not willing to sell my vote from my desk  but he says it is better for me and for my district to try to get along and thats what im doing  asked about the reconciliation a spokeswoman for craddick alexis delee said the speaker and he have had a conversation and we look forward to working with him  smith says no particular result changed his mind craddicks candidates generally did better than those of his opponents both in march and in the april runoffs and smith thinks the math is clear itll be craddick or a democrat  if midland city councilman bill dingus is ineligible to run for the state legislature  as a federal judge contended in a ruling this week  he could be replaced on the ballot by an eligible democrat and he might be his own replacement lawyers are still poring over the decision from us district judge walter smith of waco it didnt order dingus off the ballot but stopped just short of it the court agrees that a person holding a lucrative office such as a member of the midland city council is not eligible to become a candidate for the texas legislature  dingus was relying on another judges opinion when he signed up for the hd82 race while remaining on the council lawyers are looking for a remedy if dingus is illegal as judge smith says he cant cure the problem by simply resigning instead democrats would have to knock him off the ballot and then replace him with someone selected by party official from the districts five counties crane dawson martin midland and upton theyre still pondering but the leading candidate is bill dingus he could in one scenario get knocked off the ballot resign from the city council and win the support of those county officials that would take him off the council but hed remain on the ballot to face republican representative and house speaker tom craddick in november if the texas democratic party chair declares me ineligible i will resign my office on city council and will actively seek to be the replacement nominee for the office selected by the state executive committee dingus said in an email craddick didnt directly comment we have no involvement in the lawsuit and we are leaving it to the courts to decide said alexis delee a spokeswoman for craddick republican john cornyns got 87 million in his campaign accounts thats about 25 times what rick noriegas got us senator john cornyn raised 21 million during the first three months of the year and spent 12 million bringing his reelection war chest to 87 million that balance would be enough according to one consultant to pay for about five weeks of the sort of saturation tv ads cornyn will want at the end of the race his challenger democratic state representative rick noriega raised 497984 during the quarter spent 838690 and had 329293 on hand at the end of march unlike cornyn he had to run a close primary during that period noriega barely cleared 50 to avoid a runoff and also changed fundraisers and campaign managers during that period with the new team on board the campaign said fundraising has picked up during the election cycle so far cornyn has raised about 135 million noriega has raised 14 million  just over 10 percent of cornyns take one of the doublevoters in the hd73 primary runoffrecountcourt fight manages the campaign that went to court to sue for vote fraud doug millers campaign says the list of people who voted twice  a list supplied by representative nathan macias  includes several of his supporters by their count that includes a major macias donor a county treasurer two justices of the peace two elected constables the senior pastor of a major church the director of adult ministries at the same church the youth pastor at another church and two city council members  they didnt name anyone other than randall sabine the campaign manager lawyers for macias arent disputing who is and who isnt on the list but say the list came from the texas secretary of state and not from their camp if the state has someone in the database as having run twice well look at it said trey trainor macias has also asked for a new judge in the case trainor says theyre allowed to object to one judge without cause he wouldnt say what their reasoning was and theres no ruling yet on wholl preside in that case theyll be back in court next week its a little over an hour long but if you want to hear his fellow officeholders telling great stories about the late bob bullock the university of texas has video of a panel discussion on the former legislator comptroller and lieutenant governor the panel features former lt govs bill hobby and ben barnes former house speakers gib lewis and pete laney and barnes and dave mcneely and jim henderson the authors of bob bullock god bless texas the moderator was the lbj schools paul stekler and theres an appearance near the end by state auditor john keel a former bullock aide who doesnt like the book and stood up to say so department of corrections part 1 democrat kalandra wheeler of euless somehow escaped the list of contested races we ran last week heres a copy corrected to include her shes running against representative todd smith reuless in hd92 and that means the numbers are a little different than our tally to wit 72 house seats are at least theoretically in play with candidates from both major parties on the ballot of those 32 are currently held by republicans 30 by democrats and the ten open seats were previously held by eight republicans and two democrats sorry sorry sorry department of corrections part 2 we pulled numbers from the wrong chart in a settlement agreement concerning the states highcost universal service fund that fund used to subsidize phone service in areas where costs are higher than the prices paid by customers is being trimmed to 2365 million a 144 million cut and heres where we messed up and need to get the record straight under the settlement which still needs regulatory approval verizons subsidy would be cut to 69 million from 97 million att would be cut to 44 million from 160 million embarq and windstream would get 375 million and 86 million respectively as against 44 million and 94

the lobby and to republican donors in a job where policing the capitol is part of the assignment and in a primary where elephants arent welcome montford said lehmberg was getting her support in part from criminal defense attorneys who regularly do battle with the countys prosecutors related on the friday before the election house parliamentarian terry keel filed a criminal complaint against political consultant kelly fero at issue an online posting accusing keel of helping montford in the runoff keel says the website that posted that belongs to fero who was on lehmbergs campaign payroll she sacked him in the wake of the keel story and who  in keels view  was laundering news he could then use to boost lehmbergs chances against montford feros lawyer buck wood of austin called the complaint frivolous and said the statements on the blog werent  in legal terms  campaign communications theres no violation of state election laws he said you can say anything you want on your blog this is not an ad  and he suggested keel wouldnt have filed a complaint if the election werent imminent this all about tuesday wood said fero called keel one of travis countys most litigious republicans and poohpoohed the complaint terry keel carries his law license like a bludgeon whether hes trying to bully a judicial opponent off the ballot or punish a democrat who caught him trying to

the contested house seats the democrats 11 in congress two in the senate and 30 in the house that leaves ten open seats in the house that have major party candidates on both sides of the ledger in november eight arewere held by republicans and two by democrats heres the cheat sheet the texas supreme court will rehear entergy v summers a case that prompted an outcry from labor and other interests when the court decided it last year its a workers compensation case that turns on whether a company can avoid premise liability by labeling itself a general contractor a worker hurt on entergy property sued but was tossed because the company was acting as a general contractor and paying workers compensation premiums the court didnt set a date for the rehearing the rehearing of a unanimous ruling could take the issue off the table in this years political races three incumbent justices are on the ballot in november  youd have predicted this if you sat down and thought about it but the fundraising pitch for house democrats in texas is the same one tom craddick and the republicans used in the 1990s when they were in the minority the texas house democratic campaign committee says democrats need only five seats to a majority  they tout the distance theyve covered from a low point of 88 republicans and 62 democrats to the current 7971 the leader of that group waco representative jim dunnam is borrowing a page from the current speaker who ran campaigns called 76 in 96 and 8 in 98 on his way to winning a majority after redistricting in 2002 that election year flipped the republicans from a 7278 minority to an 8862 majority  the tax courts are out of the comptrollers control now they were moved last year to the state office of administrative hearings and the people who practice before them are welcome at susan combs fundraisers again brint ryan  head of dallasbased ryan  co  was among the contributors at a combs funder at the home of dallas cowboys owner jerry jones this week ive got a firewall now between us and the tax judges combs says  martin cuellar  brother of us representative henry cuellar rlaredo  edged out the incumbent sheriff of webb

the spot currently held by senator kyle janek rhouston who has announced hell resign at the end of may that probably sets up a special election on november 4 to fill the last two years of janeks fouryear term  democrat kristi thibaut got her second endorsement from annies list a pac set up to elect democratic women to the legislature she had the groups endorsement two years ago against the same republican representative jim murphy of houston thibaut got 417 percent the first time but her supporters are betting the presidential contest will change the math in hd133 state and local governments will cover about 7 million of the costs of holding the ncaa mens final four in san antonio with a fund designed to make texas attractive for big events like that comptroller susan combs wants to expand the program in time for the 2011 super bowl in arlington allowing promoters to cover the expenses of more events that will in turn bring in more tax money the state has four funds set up to lure sporting and other events that could  without a competitive edge  go to other states for big sporting events like the final four or the super bowl the state figures up the economic impact and what it means in terms of taxes on sales hotel rooms motor vehicles and drinks they agree to reimburse approved expenses based on that and on local government tax breaks and figure theyll make up the expenses and then some from indirect and induced spending that results from the event in the case of the final four the state agreed to pay up to 61 million if the expenses were approved and if the local governments would put up 973000 and they figured the state would bring in about twice that amount in taxes on spending associated with the event  money that wouldnt be spent they figure if the final four had gone to another state texas already won the 2011 super bowl but theres a move to expand the tax breaks to include eventrelated spending over a longer period of time andor to include benefits from nondirect spending say the economists broaden their economic impact study to cover more than a twoweek window or to include indirect and induced spending in their numbers either would make more money available to the locals for reimbursement combs says they might be able to add to their event planning as a result and bring more money into state coffers as a result its an incentive  not a subsidy she says its a net moneymaker  utility regulators are considering a deal that would cut 144 million from a subsidy paid to phone companies that provide service in highcost areas thats less than the 263 million in cuts proposed by the staff of the states public utility commission but all of the companies involved in the fight have signed off on it we wrote about the tentative deal last month the puc will get a chance to ratify it in a couple of weeks the socalled universal service fund is filled with a 44 percent tax on all phone bills the money goes to four companies that provide service in areas that were labeled highcost when the fund was created in the mid1990s right now its a 3949 million per year deal the new agreement would whittle that over four years time the four companies  att verizon embarq and windstream  asked for 755 million annually the puc staff recommended a total of 132 million per year this settlement puts the total at 2365 million  somewhere between the current amount and the staff proposal verizons subsidy would be cut to 69 million from 97 million att would be cut to 44 million from 160 million embarq and windstream would get 375 million and 86 million respectively as against 44 million and 94 million now the agreement doesnt specify when or by how much that 44 percent charge on phone bills should drop simply saying that it

A Fling or a Trend?	2008-03-10	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2008/03/10/a-fling-or-a-trend/	en	texas republicans have never had a primary like this one they got a quarter of a million more voters to the polls this year than they did in the presidential primaries four years ago and they werent the big story texas democrats havent voted in these numbers since the days when their primary was a de facto general election the last time more than two million people voted in a texas democratic primary was 1972  when the state had presidential and gubernatorial candidates on the same ticket this year  the first time texas was an important part of the primary map for democratic presidential candidates since the days of lbj  29 million people voted altogether the two parties followed their record early voting by turning out 4252386 voters  just under the number that voted in the 2006 general election that gave governor rick perry a second full term who are these people not everyone answers that the same way pollster daron shaw a political science prof at the university of texas at austin said 15 to 20 percent of the people voting in the democratic primary had some republican voting history so there was some crossover but he and others say it wasnt out of line with some past elections pollster mike baselice puts the number lower at 9 to 15 percent but sees some crossover another republican pollster bryan eppstein of fort worth puts that crossover number in the same range and thinks most of the new voters in the two primaries were borrowed from november theyre new to the primaries but not to the polls and he concludes that the turnout boom is a fling and not a trend  and that novembers numbers wont be as far out of line as the primary numbers were leland beatty a democratic numbercruncher was most interested in exit polling that showed women over 40 holding onto their share of the primary vote  46 to 48 percent  in spite of the growth in the number of voters they still made up more than twofifths of the vote just as they usually do and that helped hillary clinton stave off barack obama latinos also held onto their share of the democratic primary vote he says further bolstering clinton baselice says the hispanics came late partly accounting for the differences in early voting  obama won  and election day voting which went strongly toward clinton barack obama won the early voting in texas but lost that lead and then some on election day several things went right for hillary clinton and wrong for her rival  she successfully dominated the conversation during the last five days of the contest combining words on the trail and more importantly in the endlessly repeating news cycle on the internet cable and broadcast tv and radio and newspapers with her 3 am  commercials raising doubts about obamas experience  obama didnt close the deal opening a new front in this political war before locking things up in texas he was still battling with clinton when he began taking on republican john mccain had that worked wed all be talking about what a nice job of positioning hed done to move her out of the spotlight and convince voters it was a twoperson contest instead mccains response to obamas nudging reinforced clintons attacks on obamas experience  obama who was well behind clinton in most midfebruary polls appeared to catch up he narrowly won the states early vote but her strong close  and the fact that some of her voters waited until election day  put him away people who made their decisions in the last three days went her way 6436 percent according to exit polling thats with both candidates working the state but clinton and her gang running a particularly tough schedule she won in more than a dozen counties where hed taken the early vote more importantly she widened her margins in several counties where she led the early voting when the votes were tallied obama won in just 24 of the states 254 counties but that small number hides some big counties collin dallas denton fort bend harris tarrant and williamson one county coryell landed the tennis ball right on top of the net 2434 people voted for clinton and 2434 voted for obama according to the texas secretary of state clinton ended up winning in 15 counties where she was behind in early voting obama didnt flip any counties from her early vote win column to his side on election day and to improve her numbers at the end she had to win big on election day in fact she got 534 percent of that days vote her final overall number was 509 percent and even in counties where she ultimately lost she cut into obamas numbers a big fat example clinton only got 433 percent of the harris county vote but in early voting she got 374 percent and on election day she got 479 percent she lost the county and not by a little but that change brought almost 24000 votes into her column when all the votes were counted she beat obama by 101029 with almost a quarter of the margin attributable to the harris county turnaround between friday when early voting ended and tuesday when the polls opened for political business that happened on a smaller scale in counties across the state obama arguably ran a better race on the ground the answer to that will come officially at the end of the month when democratic county and senatorial district conventions produce the first solid look at delegate counts clinton won the delegates distributed by primary voting 6561 obamas supporters expect to win those distributed according to raucous caucuses held after the polls closed this week that second group is a better measure of the campaigns ground troops one observer  democratic numbers wiz leland beatty  said obama didnt go after that part of texas that is like kansas ignoring a huge swath of west texas that behaves politically like large sections of kansas where obama beat clinton in earlier contests another  republican pollster mike baselice  thought late voting by hispanics and other groups important to clinton helped turn the result gop pollster daron shaw says it might be simpler than that i think were overanalyzing this a little bit obama had his first bad week in months and that played in  john mccain and hillary clinton got the headlines incumbents had a pretty good night eight house incumbents were defeated and a ninth faces a runoff but legislators in both parties held off wellfinanced attacks and what about battle craddick  the fight over votes for house speaker tom craddick it was a mixed bag but by our count he picked up a couple of votes democrats rick noriega got just enough votes to avoid a runoff in his us senate bid against nondancer gene kelly us representative silvestre reyes of el paso cruised to an easy win mark thompson had a wide lead in the race for railroad commission but not wide enough to avoid a runoff with dale henry sam houston beat baltazar cruz in the race for supreme

walle and former representative al edwards of houston each knocked off an incumbent respectively juan escobar paul moreno kevin bailey and borris miles making an issue of house speaker tom craddick turned out to be a nonstarter in most parts of the state both for opponents of the speaker and for people who argued that he needs more support this sort of thing can work former us house majority leader tom delay got blamed for some losses after he became politically radioactive but in this election craddick didnt set off the geiger counters in the same way among either opponents or supporters that wasnt the only good news for the speaker he picked up one or two votes on tuesday depending on how you count and on which candidate promises you think will last until the next election of a speaker in january 2009 eight house members got beat this week nine more who served during the last legislative session either resigned or decided not to seek reelection a number of legislators from both parties still face tough fights in november the short version is that the primaries didnt answer the question of wholl be speaker next session craddicks still in it but doesnt have anything locked up the speaker issue could heat up in the general election when democrats can be rallied against republican management and republicans can be rallied in favor of it and a new federal court ruling will let outsiders play in the speakers race  through political action committees and other guises  for the first time itll be tight no matter what there are 79 republicans and 71 democrats in the texas house right now when craddick won his first term breaking the centuryold democratic hold on the seat there were 88 republicans it takes 76 votes to become speaker and more support than that to comfortably hold that job tuesdays primary produced a handful of runoff races the drill early voting starts march 31 and runs for five days election day is april 8 five of the tiebreakers are for open statehouse seats ones an incumbent fighting for another term and one features the two survivors of a 10way contest for the chance to challenge an incumbent democratic congressman all of those contests are on the republican side   the democratic primary produced only one state race runoff mark thompson of hamilton didnt get quite enough votes to avoid another month of work in his bid for texas railroad commission now he faces a runoff with dale henry of lampasas who previously ran for that post as a republican henry if he makes it into the general election will be the first candidate to run against each of the three members of a sitting railroad commission hes already lost to victor carrillo and elizabeth ames jones republican michael williams is the incumbent seeking reelection this time   the herd of elephants in cd22 is down to two  dr shelley sekula gibbs with 297 percent of the primary votes and pete olson with 207 percent olson put out a press release calling for five debates with his opponent  one in each county in the district and one on a local radio station were going to start talking about something different  the specific issues olson said shelley thinks thats a brilliant idea said cb currier with the sekula gibbs campaign currier said theyd pull back from big media ads and focus on the small community of voters likely to stay in the game until april they have a lot of work to do said kevyn bazzy but in a way its easier because if you dont get a good vibe from a voter you can mark that one off and move on  bazzy who received less than two percent in the primary said olsons military experience has a chance of standing out now that the other military men  brian klock ryan rowley and bazzy himself  are out im excited for the voters that they have two good choices said jim squier who ended up with 18 percent on election day he wouldnt name a favorite its a doubleedged sword for sekula gibbs and olson a oneonone race is more intense but easier on candidates and voters  the two will try to win new support but wont have to do it from a tencandidate crowd sekula gibbs ran before losing a writein campaign to democrat nick lampson that and her shortbutturbulent tenure finishing tom delays term could draw institutional opposition to her from other politicians watch the endorsements   it was a tight race in hd52 where representative mike krusee rround rock decided not to seek reelection the work isnt done for prosecutor dee hobbs who got 318 percent and insurance executive bryan daniel with 30 percent john gordon was 83 votes behind with 292 percent and says he wont seek a recount there were three of us spending a lot of money and we were all three working real hard said gordon one of us three was going to come up short  he said he hasnt decided who hell endorse or even who has the best chance to win in april  but hes certain theyll throw in a lot of cash over the next few weeks hobbs and daniel seem to be friendly foes i wasnt sure what kind of campaign we were going to have hobbs said its been a very friendly race  im very pleased with the outcome said daniel im ready to move forward and i hope we continue to campaign on the issues  neither candidate is changing their campaign strategy both say its time to focus on keeping the voters energized for another round   martha tyroch and ralph sheffield have

craig murphy but dunning started attacking at the very end were not going to let him get away with that now  murphy said he thought shepherd was the stronger opponent but he just got a late start and didnt run a negative campaign its a classic runoff between someone whos got a proven conservative record and someone who does not said kevin brannon dunnings consultant that campaign is zeroing in on political contributions button a former dart board member made to dallas democrats including us representative eddie bernice johnson state representative terri hodge and senator royce west shepherd

Fantasy Politics	2008-02-11	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2008/02/11/fantasy-politics/	en	you can always find a candidate in texas whose campaign blueprint is dependent on a rare or unprecedented event sometimes its a political shrimp who pays the filing fee like youd pay for a lottery ticket holding the fantasy in mind for a minute and hoping or wishing that getting on the ballot will get them a leather chair in the statehouse think of victor morales first run for us senate when he beat two congressmen and a prominent lawyer in a democratic primary in 1996 or of steve mansfield a republican who unexpectedly knocked an incumbent democrat off the texas court of criminal appeals in 1994 sometimes its a big fish tony sanchez jr ran for governor on the theory that a lot of people would show up to vote who had never voted before and that theyd vote for him and other democrats on the statewide ticket some of whom might have sold him on the idea in the first place but this years unprecedented thing has some data behind it the hyperactive presidential race remains unsettled  at least on the democratic side of the ledger  and its been bumping up turnouts in other states on its way here think of it all those texans who give money to candidates on both sides of presidential elections actually lived to see some of that money get spent in their home state the texas primaries are on march 4 early voting starts just more than a week from now  on february 19 and national candidates are starting to do something they havent done in texas in years and years theyre campaigning spending money on ads and trying to gin up excitement and support the updraft will probably affect texas candidates they and their consultants and friends are trying to figure out what to do whos at risk and whos about to win the electoral lottery  republicans either lucked out or not lookit incumbents running for reelection are already nervous about what might be an electorate looking for change a presidential candidate pushing that message brings more people to the polls supposedly in search of fresh faces new candidates without a gop primary to speak of turnout might be normal good for incumbents bad for challengers local mileage can vary however those incumbents still have to work on whatever made them nervous in the first place state lawmakers who were on the watch list two weeks ago  when most people thought super tuesday would settle this round of the national debate  are still on the watch list today  democrats have a different take on this say youre in a district where voter turnouts are generally low representative kevin bailey dhouston is an example he got 70 percent of the vote in the 2006 democratic primary but only won by 517 votes in a district where 1295 people bothered to show up for the primary compare that to say norma chavez del paso she got 70 percent too and her raw vote margin was 3910 votes of 9724 cast a relatively small number of new voters could change the outcome in baileys district it could save him if the new voters dont like his challenger this time it could kill him if theyre out for change it could change the demographics of the vote bailey an anglo representing a minority district is being challenged by a latino armando lucio walle bailey can win with a standard turnout but who benefits from a higher one it depends on what the new voters want in a candidate consultants we talked to generalize in two different directions in some races incumbents have been winning with static turnouts and new voters represent the danger of change at best they dont know the incumbents and owe them no allegiance theres a flip to that say us senator hillary clinton comes to the state looking for votes and hires people in your area who have also worked for you in the past a candidate in that situation can piggyback on the wellfunded presidential campaign leveraging getoutthevote and voter contact efforts representative doro olivo drosenberg has a tough reelection race against ron reynolds of missouri city shes hispanic and hes africanamerican weve heard the argument that barack obamas presence on the ticket will help black candidates but olivos name was one of seven leading texas democrats named in obamas announcement of grassroots support in texas if youre building a watchlist for the primaries  a basis for those postprimary autopsies  put bailey and olivo on it and all the other democratic primaries you can find its hell on the candidates but itll be good material for the political science nerds after this is over  another theory holds that busy party primaries hurt moderate candidates representatives pat haggerty rel paso and charlie geren rfort worth might get votes from independents in their primaries but for the attraction of the democratic presidential fight if theyre dependent on those independents for victory  that remains to be demonstrated  the active primary could hurt them  and the consultants republican consultants are getting cheated relatively speaking if you look at election turnouts over the last 30 years in texas you see fewer and fewer people voting in primaries relative to the number of voting age people in the state last year the voting age population or vap was 166 million 12 million of them voted in the primaries so the lists of regular republicans and regular democrats are pretty well worked suppose you could get an election that boosted the pool of voters take the full list of names delete those on the old list and youve got a lot of fresh leads for the next election cycle thats the election cycle by the way that picks the legislators wholl redraw legislative and congressional political maps in 2011 democrats assuming they get a big turnout next month will get lots of new leads republicans without a fight to draw a crowd wont unlike the rest of this those lists dont come available just where there are hot local races the presidential draw to the polls  if it turns out to do here what its done elsewhere  is statewide new voters could be showing up in parts of texas where the local races arent even interesting the bloom in voting around the country has texas politicos wondering whatll happen to turnout here both in the march primaries and in november four years ago just over 15 million people voted in the democratic and republican primaries here  about 95 percent of the states voting age population we decided to go nuts with the historic numbers to get an idea of previous turnouts and to get ready for march 4 when well find out just how jazzed people really are about these primaries this first chart is all regular state elections from 1970 to now the sharks mouth line covers general elections with presidential and gubernatorial candidates on board more people vote in presidential years and thats why you get that sawtooth pattern democrats fell from the big turnouts of a oneparty state to the lower turnouts that mark our presentday politics this one maps raw vote totals in presidential primary years the states population has grown as has the general election vote total and the parties over the years have reached rough parity at least in turnouts the total number of voters who show up for primary elections has declined in recent years in spite of growth in the states population fewer texans vote in gubernatorial election years but the trends match more or less those of presidential election years finally we put the prexies and the goobers are on the same chart and filtered out population growth by ditching raw vote totals in favor of turnout as a percentage of voting age population if this is a normal year  that is if the soothsayers are wrong and turnouts do what theyve always done  40 to 50 percent of the states voting age population will vote in november the democratic primary will draw 5 to 7 percent and the gop primary will draw 4 to 8 percent a note republican primary turnouts in texas were higher than normal in the last two cycles as they had a texas republican on the ballot republican us representatives sam johnson and ralph hall are accustomed to winning and in spite of their advanced years  johnson is 77 and hall is 84  neither is throwing in the towel this year that didnt stop a crowd from signing up to run against them eight republicans and four democrats are saying in effect that after 18 years in the house for johnson and 28 for hall times up the two have gotten used to people wondering if theyll retire but both reps say their work is never done the races are worth watching because each candidate has more than one primary opponent meaning more chances to split the vote theres a chance lightning will strike and theres a chance that even in losing this years candidates are positioning themselves for the day when the two incumbents move on still its hard to ignore their victorious history in 2006 johnson won close to 63 percent against democrat dan dodd and libertarian christopher claytor hall won almost 65 percent that year against democrat glenn melancon and libertarian kurt helm their winning numbers have been even higher in previous years johnsons cd3 includes plano mckinney and richardson hes been in the house since 1991 and did six years in the texas house before that he was a pow in vietnam hes got two opponents in the upcoming republican primary financial wizard and selfproclaimed dweeb wayne avellanet and retired pilot harry pierce both from plano attorney tom daley and retired teacher and broker ronald minkow are vying for the democratic spot claytor an engineer returns as the sole libertarian according to the center for responsive politics johnson has almost 800000 in campaign funds  far more than his opponents could hope to rake in at 84 years old hall has been in the house since 1981 he was a state senator for ten years  then a private citizen for eight years  before winning his spot in congress the world war ii veteran represents cd4 which includes parts of mesquite and rockwall four republican hopefuls are also running in the primary businessmen gene christensen and kevin george joshua kowart and former frisco mayor kathy seei the democrats are valinda hathcox who challenged jerry patterson for land commissioner in 2006 and repeat candidate melancon the crp says hall has about 350000 hall doesnt need a lot of money to get the word out the same theory should hold for johnson and the congressmen arent worried about their gray hairs either the average age of a rep is 55 according to the congressional research service ive always felt like the tenure in congress is important to getting stuff done up here says johnson i think theres a lot to do and ill stay up here as long as i can beat people over the head and make things happen  hall who says he runs at least a mile every morning and does about 50 situps before bed says he still has something to give  his wife mary ellen is the driving force behind his choice to run again he says hall says she thought having his name on the ballot would help their son brett hall win his third term as district judge in rockwall but hall the younger doesnt have an opponent this may be my last go round says hall but the president might need one old geezer still i dont recommend a floor full of 84yearold guys  his opponents  and johnsons  agree completely minkow one of the democrats in johnsons race is 70 years old johnson has lost touch with his electorate he says a lot of people just stick with the status quo says pierce one of johnsons republican opponents it takes courage to vote for someone new  avellanet who has a big family rooted in plano is more optimistic about his own chances but jokes that hell probably be proven wrong if i dont get elected thats fine ill be around for another 30 years and sam johnson wont  but karl voigtsberger vicechairman of the collin county republicans and candidate for county tax assessor says he hasnt seen johnsons opponents around town and he doesnt think he ever will there are always people who decide one day they want to be a congressman and thats the last we hear from them  ready to challenge hall again melancon says the congressman has lost touch with his district i dont think its good for anybody to be in washington that long it has a way of corrupting people he says bill broderick chairman of the rockwall country republican party says rockwall county is hall country  hes not sure if hall can carry 50 percent of the vote with four opponents in the primary but he says none of the other republicans stand out as far as halls age broderick says youd never know how old the guy is when i get around sam johnson i feel his age but i dont get that feeling with hall  hall opponent christensen is 53 years old he says if he won hed put a term limit on himself at 10 years youve gotta know when to get on the train and when to get off  democrat hathcox says the economy is the biggest issue in her district mentioning that the popeyes and kfc nearby closed recently but hathcox says thats just increased business for the chicken express in this chicken war as she puts it there are winners and losers its kind of like the races  someone is always hoping someone else will close their doors  by karie meltzer fort worths jim wright  former speaker of the us house and one of the states super delegates to the democratic national convention  endorsed hillary clinton for president that announcement came as the results from super tuesday were rolling in making it apparent that the democratic side of the presidential race is probably coming all the way to texas in march  now that the republican nomination is all but locked up for us senator john mccain hes won the endorsement of us senator john cornyn rsan antonio cornyn said in his announcement that he didnt want to get involved in the primaries while they were still competitive now though he wants the gop to settle in behind one candidate  it looks like the presidential candidates will have a texas debate  probably at the end of the month  as they campaign for big seams of votes here and in ohio that come available on march 4 thats one of two  the others in ohio  that barack obama has agreed to before the primaries here clintons pushing for one a week  former representative ron wilson loaned 30000 to larhonda torry the democrat challenging representative garnet coleman dhouston theres an old fight there coleman helped representative alma allen defeat wilson in 2004 two other notes former judge morris overstreet contributed to torry and torrys 30day report didnt list a treasurer  an issue coleman tried to use last month to knock her off the ballot  the gambling pot hasnt spilled at least as of the last report texans for economic development pac funded by gaming interests around the state has more than 1 million to spend but spent only 15000 in january according to their report that money went to representative kino flores dpalmview  house speaker tom craddicks contribution to a political action committee helping three friendly democrats is the only reported money thats gone from him to a particular race representatives flores kevin bailey and aaron pe got 50000 each from texas jobs  opportunity build a secure future inc pac and craddick giving 250000 was that funds biggest funder another craddick beneficiary  85000 worth  was the stars over texas pac which hasnt given to candidates yet but has paid dave carneys norway hill associates 122500 for consulting and research  state representative rafael anchia ddallas endorsed obama in the democratic primary with this line i dont buy the argument that latinos will not vote for an africanamerican candidate for president  anchia says texas hispanics will identify with obamas story  former texas education commissioner mike moses endorsed jonathan sibley a republican challenging

Edwards vs. Miles IV: The Final Showdown (Maybe) - The Texas ...	2012-05-22	TEXAS OBSERVER	http://www.texasobserver.org/edwards-vs-miles-iv-the-final-showdown-maybe/	en	texas house district 146 looks like a dragon drawn with an etchasketch thats because the largely black and hispanic district on houstons south side has been gerrymandered over the years ensuring it remained one of the citys poorest its also played host to a tragicomic political grudgematch that will see its fourth iteration in next weeks democratic primary the districts largest chunk surrounds the intersection of highway 288 and the 610 loop but does not extend south to the texaco station at 288 and almeda genoa yet this is where district 146s erstwhile elder statesman al edwards has insisted that i meet him really  i said ill meet you anywhere you want really i dont mind  no lets do that texaco edwards said theyve got a place to sit in the back  the texaco is sizeable with a gravel lot for big rigs i park next to the only black mercedesedwards is a real estate broker10 minutes late because edwards initially directed me to the wrong exit edwards is standing by the checkout counter which is encased in bulletproof glass talking on the phone hes tall and wearing a loose suit with a brown tie from alpha eta lambda a black fraternity he is 75 edwards represented district 146 from 1979 until 2006 when he was ousted in the democratic primary by newcomer borris miles now 47 edwards won his seat back in 2008 then lost it again to miles in 2010 this year he expects to get it back edwards eyes me as i click through the sliding doors ill call you back he says the reporters here  this texaco has a subway sandwich shop but thats not where edwards leads me off to the side adjacent to a small fry counter is a room with white booths and a mounted television showing divorce court exhausted men are scattered at the tables and their cell phones all of which seem to play accordion music go off regularly the air is redolent of corndogs as soon as were settled edwards kicks off our chat in the first person then drifts into the third the thing that im try to educate folks on and make them aware of is how the legislative process works because if you dont know how it works youre gonna do some strange things to yourself why throw away 28 or 30 experienced years for two or three years  he asks rhetorically the person with 28 or 30 yearshe didnt lie he didnt get caught stealing he didnt get caught raping some child and hes producing why would you get rid of that person  the answer if you listen to edwardss critics is that he wasnt producing edwards knows it when people especially my opponent say that i havent done anything thats the most absurd statement a person can make he says i tried to interview miles for this article but his headquarters didnt answer multiple emails and phone calls and appeared not to have a voicemail box i put medical doctors in the community for free edwards says referring to house bill 2154 which he authored in 2009 it arranged to pay off student loans for doctors who promised to work in medically underserved communities for four years its free because i made the tax on nonsmoking tobacco equal to other tobacco he says although that amendment was written by republican warren chisum edwards also describes his hb 2153 as having introduced regular registration for sex offenders but actually his bill applied only to homeless sex offenders who are now required to update police about where they usually stay sex offenders with homes were already required to register as further proof of his productivity edwards mentions having cosponsored the original childrens health insurance program chip legislation which provided health insurance to children of working families he doesnt mention that he was one of 53 sponsors and cosponsors i ask him about a bill he authored in 1989 that proposed amputating the fingers of convicted drugs dealers he stands by it drug dealers should be punished for selling drugs to our young folk edwards says a lot of countries where they dont have the problem its because they have some form of penalty so i drafted a bill that said if you are found guilty of selling drugs to our young folk then we would consider maybe chopping part of your finger off  i ask if he was serious that was real serious he says i bet if that were the case today we wouldnt have the kind of drug problems the rapes the imprisonment the killing that we have today  he looks a little crestfallen but it didnt pass  then he perks up i thought you were gonna ask me about the cheerleaders he says edwards earned national attention in 2005 when the introduced the ultimately unsuccessful booty bill which banned sexy dancing by high school cheerleaders the daily show interviewed edwards for a segment on the bill called no childs sweet behind in which edwards correlated sexy cheerleading with the herpes or catchin aids  i ask how cheerleaders would know when theyd crossed the line edwards narrowed his eyes and laughed oh they know  he says theeeeeeeey know  edwardss prohibitionary spirit may come from his work as a lay minister at progressive new hope baptist church his wikipedia entry and virtually every source with a biography of him says he has a doctorate in divinity which i ask about uhhuh i have two doctorates one from south texas and another one from the university of belize  me south texas  he clarifies south texas enrichment and theological me seminary school  institute he says and the university of belize honorary doctorates  i say i knew i must have the name wrong because his wikipedia page says world bible christian university thats what it is thats right world bible christian university edwards interrupts but i hadnt been able to find any record of world bible christian university other than citations about edwards id even called the association of theological schools commission on accrediting who said theyd never heard of it edwards looks thoughtful i think it got merged with somebody else or closed he says im not sure that university still exists  we return to his legislative record at last edwards mentions the bill for which he is best known it made juneteenth emancipation day a paid holiday that was in 1979 during edwards first term edwards opponent miles earned most of his notoriety outside the legislative chamber after being elected in 2006 miles shot one of two burglars he found stealing copper from the construction site of his new home the burglar survived and miles who had a concealed carry permit was not charged then in january of 2008 the harris county district attorneys office investigated miles after witnesses claimed he crashed the party of a rival businessman david harris miles owns an insurance company miles allegedly appeared intoxicated kissed harris on both cheeks and then the mouth brandished a gun and kissed harriss wife before leaving these incidents probably contributed to miless loss to edwards in 2008 citing miless past partying edwards publicly challenged him in 2010 to take a drug test within 72 hours though it was more than 72 hours later miles accepted also publiclyhe took the urinalysis live on local radio he passed miles beat edwards in 2010 by only eight votes out of more than 5000 in his two terms miles has authored joint authored or amended 25 pieces of legislation as we walk together back out to edwardss mercedes he speculates that i wasnt able to reach miles because he was in a hospital getting cleaned up  he hasnt changed edwards says chuckling we laugh at him all the time he hasnt changed  it seems very little in district 146 has emily deprang joined the texas observer in 2011 as a staff writer covering criminal justice and public health before that she was nonfiction editor of the sonora review before that she was a waitress shes also appeared in the atlantic saloncom and vice she holds an mfa in

a mudslinging  puppet with houston handlers shes portrayed the 71yearold incumbent  as a misogynist faux conservative with a long history of ethical  lapses the third candidate new braunfels doctor

                          HISD audit finds some trustee intervention in contracts         	2012-03-29	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://blog.chron.com/k12zone/2012/03/hisd-audit-finds-some-trustee-intervention-in-contracts/	en	auditors hired to investigate houston isds contract process said thursday that trustees should stop intervening on behalf of businesses abstain from votes on contracts involving big campaign donors and disclose all gifts they take from vendors the auditors also noted that documents went missing from one file that involved a suspect deal and they reported that in some cases it was unclear why particular vendors were selected trustees should abstain from votes involving vendors who contribute more than 250 a year to their political campaigns the audit report said in addition trustees who hold leadership positions with vendors including nonprofits should disclose the relationships and abstain from votes involving those entities asked during a board meeting thursday whether trustees used improper influence auditor charles yaple said we did not find that to be run amok but we did find certain situations that came up in our interview process  the audit report said some unnamed board members had contacted the district administration on behalf of construction vendors who werent awarded contracts the former procurement chief agreed to meet with two companies including westco ventures which is run by a close friend of hisd trustee paula harris after the meeting the company and two others were added to the deal harris previously told the houston chronicle that she contacted the districts chief financial officer about that project harris who was not at the board meeting thursday was out of town according to the board manager on that same deal which involved minor general contracting services for under 25000 the auditors said documents went missing after they reviewed the file the procurement staff told the auditors that the file had been reviewed by several parties including the general public and that might have led to misplaced paperwork the confidentiality agreements signed by the bid evaluation team were missing and the evaluation scorecard had different numbers the second time the auditors reviewed the file hisd trustee juliet stipeche said she was deeply disturbed that documents went missing and called for further investigation when she asked if hisd had a record retention policy board president mike lunceford said yes then quipped unless somebody takes it the records out  the auditors also recommended that trustees disclose any trips or entertainment such as tickets to an athletic event that they receive from vendors the disclosure rule would be tighter than state law which allows trustees to keep those gifts confidential if they attend the events with the vendors as their guest trustee larry marshall did not report a trip to costa rica  which was arranged by state representative borris miles an hisd insurance vendor  until after the chronicle and other media reported it marshall initially said he did not have to report the trip  where he explored the possibility of sending hisd employees abroad for medical care  because miles attended and the costa rican government paid for it most trustees told the auditors that they did not fully understand existing conflictofinterest and ethics policies the auditors suggested annual training following your existing policies should work well for you yaple of the audit firm nulllairson told the trustees at a public meeting thursday another problem the auditors found in their review of 15 contracts was a lack of backup documentation showing why some vendors were selected the district should not automatically exclude vendors with ties to board members the auditors said but should seek an opinion from its inspector general or attorney on whether the deal is a conflict or benefit of interest  some hisd trustees have listed their memberships on other boards in their profiles on the districts website but the auditors suggested mandatory disclosure and abstention from votes you could run into a conflict of loyalty said auditor celina knippling of mgt of america stipeche asked what rules should apply to the administration superintendent terry grier serves on the board of the college board the nonprofit that administers advanced placement exams and sells curriculum to hisd lunceford noted that grier told the board about the appointment lunceford said he hopes to bring policy changes to a board vote in may after superintendent terry griers staff and the boards policy committee review the audit findings and an earlier procurement review in more detail hisd spent 13590 on a procurement review conducted earlier this year by the council of the great city schools the board hired the audit firm nulllairson agreeing to spend up to 87500 to avoid concerns that the councils report could be influenced by griers membership on its executive committee the audit is below hisd procurement audit
                          Who not to vote for 2012         	2012-03-20	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://blog.chron.com/kuffsworld/2012/03/who-not-to-vote-for-2012/	en	 there are a number of interesting and exciting democratic primary races on this years ballot you can see a bunch of them here and here there are many good candidates and many races in which you may have a difficult choice but cant really make a bad choice unfortunately that is not true for all races there are a few right here in harris county that include candidates that no rational selfrespecting democrat should ever support the main danger is that in a lowinformation race these candidates all will attract some support the best antidote for that is to ensure that you know who you are dealing with with that in mind this is my slate of people you should not even consider voting for not because i dont like them or because i disagree with them but because they do not represent democratic values in any meaningful sense and will do real harm to the rest of the ticket if they are accidentally nominated first up is someone who did get accidentally nominated in 2010 and who did cause harm by doing so i refer to cd22 candidate kesha rogers who is a larouchie and impeachment advocate but who won the 2010 primary anyway because no one was paying attention theres no excuse this time rogers is running against kp george a perfectly nice respectable sane democrat whose interview ill be publishing in the next week or two the fort bend county democratic party has officially endorsed kp george and i hope the hcdp will make an exception in this case as well and has been working to stop kesha rogers for some time we will have no one to blame but ourselves if she gets nominated again another candidate to watch out for would have been on the ballot in 2010 if he hadnt been disqualified from the ballot is the notorious hatemonger and perennial candidate dave wilson who is once again seeking to pollute the waters in commissioners court precinct 4 i trust youre aware of mr wilsons shameful resume by now so i will simply note that he is opposed by sean hammerle whose interview is here and that if we have any clue at all it will be hammerle on the ballot in november harris county da candidate lloyd oliver another perennial who usually runs for a judicial seat doesnt have quite the long history that some of these other folks do but hes basically a nobody who escaped a barratry charge in 2010 and certainly wont be an asset to the ticket the way that zack fertitta unquestionably will and then there was this reply he sent to carl whitmarsh after whitmarsh sent out news about the justice department spiking the hideous voter id law  seems a giant step backwardsif you will not get an official state id you are probably an illegal alien or a convictdont now who you arebut stop sending me your email crap  well i dont now about you but i sure dont want this clown on my ballot please help make that not happen by voting for zack fertitta whose interview is here finally there is one candidate who will sadly be on the ballot no matter what you do because he has no primary opponent i am not going to name this individual because he has a history of harassment but he is the democrat running in sd07 against senator dan patrick hes a crazy perennial candidate who used to run as a republican before deciding to inflict himself on us a few years ago and if you never believe another word i say believe me when i say he is not worth your vote id suggest that you vote for the green party candidate in this race in november but they failed to put someone up in that race which is a pity since its one where they would have provided a clearly better alternative i dont know if there will be a libertarian there or not but it doesnt really matter my advice for those of you who are stuck in sd07 is to leave this one blank if you vote a straight ticket go back to the sd07 race and uncheck the candidate there  either party im not picky  and then cast your vote youll feel better afterward so thats my list of people who are unworthy of your vote in may this is not to say that there arent clear choices in some other races  i would certainly recommend voting for sheriff adrian garcia and for state representatives garnet coleman and borris miles for example  but at least the other candidates in those races can be safely called democrats these are the races in which to avoid unforced errors if you know of others where its not a matter of dislike or disapproval but of outright disgrace and disgust leave a comment and let me know warning anything that falls outside that clear boundary will be deleted

In the Wee Hours, a House Budget is Born	2015-04-01	TEXAS OBSERVER	http://www.texasobserver.org/in-the-wee-hours-a-house-budget-is-born/	en	there would be blood promised state representative jonathan stickland rbedford lawmakers were fed up they werent gonna take it anymore but in the end as if the texas house was a kindlytreated carrie there was none just five of 150 reps voted against the 2098 billion budgeta relatively pitiful showing from noon on tuesday to just short of 6 am on wednesday the house worked through hundreds of amendments to its budget house bill 1 although deliriumand perhaps some more potent intoxicantsbrought out the worst in a number of legislators house leadership was able to avoid most of the pressing fights that might have come before it democrats and republicans voluntarily withdrew many of their most divisive bills over abortion and immigration even stickland played along the nights headlining bout state representative abel herreros drobstown attempt to preemptively ban vouchers for the second year in a row likewise was canceled though word had it that his amendment came down primarily to save republicans a tough votevouchers being perhaps dead in the house anyway what to make of it in previous yearsespecially in tough budget years like 2011the house budgeting process was a carnival people scrapped over money and both democrats and far right republicans fought the middle even if just for show this year though the fire is gone from the belly of the tea party to some degree and theres a sense among most of the house that the enemy is the senate that didnt stop a few unusual amendments from getting passed and a few legislators from saying things they shouldnt have at the top of the list in both categories might be state representative stuart spitzer rkaufman who authored an amendment to take 15 million per year from the states hivstd prevention program and use it to juice abstinence education theres a word for the idea behind debating a budget for 16 hours straight until the birds on the capitol lawn are greeting the morning its stupid  in the course of the debate spitzerwho said the states goal should be to ensure no one has sex before marriagetold the crowd hed only ever had sex with one woman his wife when he got married at age 29 he recommended it for this he was subject to a mildly ungentlemanly remark from state representative harold dutton dhouston but spitzers story shows how state government is getting more tolerantnot too long ago admitting to your colleagues youd only had sex with one woman would be a serious political liability at the lege less funny is that spitzers amendment passed easily though its an open question whether his amendment is going to stay in the budget he did not give any sign of being especially wellliked by those in control last night when he offered a measure to move money from arts programs to courthouse preservation efforts another republican successfully amended his amendment so that the money would instead come from a community college in his own district forcing him to voluntarily withdraw his bid things got sloppier through the night when state representative scott sanford rmckinney offered a bill to put a dent in the texas lottery commission citing the need to protect the poor state representative borris miles dhouston passionate but slurring his words a bit told sanford at 242 am he was full of shit  hours later reps called points of order on six consecutive bills as if just for the fun of it one killed an illconceived attempt to prohibit txdot from funding rail projects an attempt by representative tony dale rcedar park to hack more than 50 million out of the health  human services budget to pay for sweet new airplanes for dps border operations was defeated though by one of the closer votes of the night at 353 am an angry representative debbie riddle rtomball slammed state representative matt krause rfort worth over his bid to kill the racing commission with a sentence that started with if you had any respect for horses  democrats spent much of the evening trying to add data reporting to the budget most of them were defeated one amendment by state representative mary gonzalez dclint aimed to expose gender pay discrepancies in state agencies it was torched too earlier in the night state representative trey martinez fischer d san antonio offered a series of symbolic amendments trumpeted by the texas democratic party to increase school funding and attempt to force the attorney general to settle the states school funding lawsuit these too were easily defeated a final notetheres a word for the idea behind debating a budget for 16 hours straight until the birds on the capitol lawn are greeting the morning its stupid  the 140day calendar the lege works withand stuff is only really happening for 90 days of that or soimposes a lot of constraints even wellinformed people cant really know whats going on half the time in the capitols dark recesses thanks to the quickening pace as we head toward june but the house easily could have broken this budget debate into a couple of days so that reps were more sober and less tired and could focus on whats on the page in front of them but you know maybe thats the idea its like having toddlersget them tuckered out christopher hooks joined the observer in 2014 previously he was a freelance journalist in austin where he grew up his work has appeared in politico magazine slate and texas monthly among others he graduated from the new school in 2012 with a bachelors degree in history

by bill hobby several years ago my life changed after buying a newly constructed house that is nothing less than a lemon i soon received a reallife lesson in texas politics i became actively involved in grassroots work with certain organizations as i was reviewing votes of a particular bill i noticed a representative i was aware of voting in line with a different political party i called the legislators office spoke to the chief of staff and asked why that happened the chief of staff declared that the representative did not vote out of party i begged to differ as i had the vote in front of me i was told she would investigate and get back to me within a few hours the call came and i was told the state representative was not even present to vote she then went to clarify the issue with whomever she needed to i have also been in the gallery and have seen so many votes for so few representatives i wonder if we now need voter ids for house members before each vote is taken and i wonder what the true laws of texas might be if this were not going on would consumers really be protected from unscrupulous builders would children have the health insurance they need so badly i wonder what has happened to the ethics and morals of some elected officials hopefully things will change in the next election we need to get back to what is best for the citizens of this state marcia kushnerhouston when i first saw the video of the keyetv report in austin on this practice i was outraged and still am i quickly made my disapproval known to my state representative hubert vo and senator kyle janek as well as other state officials political watchdog groups political commentators and numerous citizens three months later the only response has been agreement and support from other concerned citizens and one measly email autoreply from governor rick perrys office there has been only resounding silence from every other quarter as is too often the case these elected officials seem concerned only with their own interests and have little or no regard for the citizens they profess to represent perhaps by lending his wellknown and respected voice to the discussion hobby can help shine the bright light of day on this and other shameful practices taking place in the halls of our government richard jensenhouston again in talk shows and debates last week there still was not one presidential candidate with the exception of john mccain sometimes who thought that the fight with alqaida was worth taking a position on the media all agreed with the candidates apparently they never asked last week a barack obama supporter called my house and asked for a contribution so i asked her what is the senators plan for fighting alqaida  she said hell get us out of iraq  i told her that i agreed that we should get out of iraq but what was the senators position on fighting the most serious threat this nation has faced in years she didnt know and couldnt find anything on his web site obama is not unique  no democrat has a plan or position and no republican has a plan or position again except for mccain sort of newspapers tv and radio dont care either they dont bother to ask about it there are other issues  the economy health care the mounting federal debt etc but are we going to elect a president who will be as poorly prepared to deal with this foreign

chronicles betting the farm editorial on jan 12 was foresighted and foreboding in regards to corporate plans to build huge fish farms in the gulf of mexico that the gulf of mexico fisheries management council the federal regulatory body tasked with maintaining and restoring gulf fisheries to their legendary diversity and richness attempted to permit these very controversial and potentially lethal fish farms while ignoring public comment is no surprise the majority of the gulf council is comprised of commercial interests that have in the past promulgated fisheries policies that drove down the population of red snapper stocks to 2 percent of their historic abundancy the gulf council should be reconstituted to include more scientists and environmental groups there is absolutely no way the earths oceans can provide all the protein required by its human population better to recognize this fact straight away take a precautionary approach to fisheries management create marine sanctuaries especially in the gulf states place a moratorium on fish farms in the gulf and most importantly reduce our consumption of animal protein including fish adopting a vegetarian diet is the single most beneficial behavior an individual can choose mark muhichsierra club galveston group galveston in regards to the editorial on fish farms commercial fishermen do not own the wild fish in the oceans and rivers venison wild ducks and geese were sold in markets in years past when that was stopped the commercial hunters survived doing something else as did the restaurants the same would be true of seafood taxes from citizens and sportsmen pay to grow fish in hatcheries and shrimpers kill them with their nets shrimp boats are followed by hordes of seagulls which are there to eat the dead small fish thrown off the boats when i was a young man there were schools of mullets that covered the surface of the water now they are rare being caught and used for animal feed and fertilizer sport fish are predators and depend on the mullet for feed we should stop all commercial fishing and allow only sport fishing the wildlife in water belongs to everyone as the wildlife in texas lands belongs to

commit to end homelessness in city  follow others lead and fix this endemic problem  while john guess jr may have nothing but good intentions his premise is based on the false idea that providing housing will magically solve this problem one need only be around a homeless person a few days to discover the blatant facts of their existence i worked in the montrose area and got to know a homeless man named bob i talked with him almost daily and found him both a combination of smart and hopeless he was unusual in the fact that he had family who cared about him every few months his brother would give him a prepaid credit card with five grand on it bob was a bigshot for a while till the money quickly was drained by buying booze and drugs for all his friends never once did he use the money to find shelter or clothe himself this is not uncommon a certain percentage of these people do not want a home they live the hobo life and can make do easily with the panhandled money they work for the harsh nature of the street is their home and they will never change i am happy the funds will be available to try to help the real solution in my mind would be to use the money to buy farms and housing in the country ship the homeless to ranches and provide measured amounts of alcohol schooling and help in either adjusting to society or living in relative safety just throwing money at it will never make homelessness go away william baileyhouston

including state representative borris miles and state senator mario gallegos both dhouston and the houston gay lesbian bisexual and transgender political caucus have endorsed the proposal the league of united latin american citizens could weigh in on the issue as early as today the africanamerican vote is not large enough to kill the bond somebody else would have to vote against it he said adding that older conservative voters would be the most likely group to join the opposition greg meyers the lone hisd trustee to vote against putting the measure on the ballot said he isnt sure where conservative voters stand saavedra may have won some of them over last week when he announced that the district would not need to raise taxes to finance the measure which includes plans to build 24 schools and renovate 134 others murray said it also is unlikely that hispanics will turn out in sufficient numbers to carry the bond themselves this isnt a normal election and it does expose more of the underlying tensions between our two large minority groups he said youve got this underlying tension building up about blacks being squeezed out of hisd  hispanics now account for nearly 60 percent of hisds 200000 students  double the percentage of black students conversely school board president manuel rodriguez jr said he hopes hispanics take advantage of their growing influence while he thinks they overwhelmingly support the bonds he worries that they wont show up to vote we need to make them realize the importance of their one vote as it comes together and makes for a powerful messagesender rodriguez said i applaud the black leaders for standing up and asking for more but we need to do whats right for these schools students and teachers who have been waiting for years  the fact that black and hispanic leaders are on opposite sides on this issue doesnt signal a growing rift said gallegos the state senator anybody thats telling you that is lying he said were not that far from bringing some of the black leadership in  others questioned whether the vocal black leadership has the same mindset as black parents on this issue the impact on the children in the northeast area and the money being spent on children in the northeast areas is such that to not want this bond issue is not rational said michael dee cochairman of parents  teachers for our public schools a political action committee supporting the bonds turner said this cant be simplified into a race issue theyre looking for a red herring and im not going to give it to them the lawmaker said this is not an issue about jobs and this is not an issue about africanamericans versus hispanics  this is about children in certain schools in certain neighborhoods being underserved  while he admits he should have sought residents opinions first saavedra said the children shouldnt pay for his mistake all the issues that have been brought forth are adult issues that should be handled by adults he said he and other proponents said they will continue working to win over the opposition im hoping real soon were going to see some unity said rick jaramillo cochairman of parents  teachers for our public schools jenniferradcliffechroncom

nothing but the publics business was left to be done but the states legislators and executive branch officials still managed to spend 96 million from their political accounts between january and june some of it was for hangover expenses from last years elections some was for lodging in austin during the legislative session other spending was for private club memberships luxury automobile leases and travel to foreign lands like turkey ghana and lithuania and there were gifts  gifts for constituents gifts for each other state law bars politicians from converting campaign donations to personal use but the definition of a legitimate political expenditure is broad though there is nothing illegal about this spending on its face some campaignfinance reform advocates say it looks improper legislators are living high on campaign dollars said tom smitty smith of public citizen you want your legislators to have safe reliable automobiles but you question whether they need bmws or lincolns smith said legislators have a right to use their campaign contributions to be seen in public but should they be using campaign dollars for posh country clubs  governor rick perry spent 588486 during the legislative session some of which was to get out of texas while the lawmakers were in town perry had widely publicized trips to pittsburgh for a boy scouts convention and to istanbul turkey to attended the secretive bilderberg conference turkey also was on the travel itinerary for senator jeff wentworth rsan antonio who spent 276 on travel to istanbul for the institute of interfaith dialogue wentworth said the institute paid his way and that the expenditure was to upgrade to more comfortable seating perry and first lady anita perry also in april slipped off to san diego for an aggie muster dropping 1387 in political funds for a twonight stay at the luxurious us grant hotel while there perry held a 78 business meeting at san diegos toprated breakfast restaurant hash house a go go perry spokeswoman krista moody said the trip was a legitimate political expense because he would not have been invited to be the keynote speaker if he had not been the aggie governor of texas  the biggest spender of the year has been lieutenant governor david dewhurst who spent 1 million including about 160000 to pay interest on campaign loans dewhursts expense reports were among the most focused on the politics of his office he spent 453000 on political consulting expenses during the legislative session including 379167 to longtime adviser buddy barfield while dewhurst spent 11768 on research through lexisnexis wentworth spent 20308 to lease a lexus wentworth said the campaign lexus is in keeping with the kind of cars he drives in his personal life he said it is necessary for driving the dangerous stretch of interstate 35 between san antonio and austin its a matter of safety wentworth said he was far from being the only lawmaker using a luxury vehicle as his campaign car it was a great opportunity to promote houston at a major world conference where about 45 of the 51 african heads of state were present ellis said in addition i assured the prime minister of ethiopia that the ancient hominid lucy exhibit will be wellprotected in houston  senator john whitmire dhouston paid 4740 to lease a bmw during the session as much time as we spend in our car the caliber is an individual decision whitmire said theres no question there are a lot of nice automobiles around the capitol but thats not an issue that our constituents judge us by  in the name of constituent entertainment whitmire spent 20072 of his political money on season tickets to see the houston astros the houston rockets the houston texans and the houston comets whitmire said he gave many of the tickets away to constituents supporters and charity events and while almost all lawmakers claimed expense account meals whitmire was a prodigious eater he hosted 63 meeting meals at restaurants such as segaris in houston bohanans in san antonio and eddie vs in austin for a cost of 5843 whitmire said he often holds meetings over meals because there is not enough time in the day to do his business otherwise whitmire said questions about the quality of the cars legislators lease or sports tickets or meals are between the lawmaker and constituents so long as the expenditure is legal the good news is its not taxpayer dollars whitmire said we are held accountable for taxpayer dollars the campaign takes on a different tone a different message  craddick spent more than 455000 during the legislative session including 60000 for his daughter to manage his political account craddick in june spent 1800 from his political account to send his wife nadine to vilnius lithuania to attend a state legislative leaders foundation conference only state representatives harold dutton and borris miles both houston democrats reported spending no money from their political accounts not counting craddick the topspending lawmaker was senator john carona rdallas whose 200119 in the debit ledger included a 61929 reimbursement to his own company for use of a corporate jet all told legislators donated 49541 in political funds this spring to booster clubs high schools and civic organizations public citizens smith said the donations provide good public exposure but he said many people would be disappointed to know the money came from a political fund  made up of money from political action committees big boosters and small individual donors alike  instead of from the politicians own pocket most texans would feel theyve been hoodwinked smith said one of kings civic donations was 500 to the millsap athletic booster club to support high school sports in the small town between weatherford and mineral wells some legislators also paid a total of 8455 in membership dues to private downtown clubs such as the austin club or the headliners club in austin or similar clubs back

organization committee bought 811 in gifts for committee members at gassane tailors in austin king turned 2400 of his political funds into gifts for his house committee members wentworth spend 969 on

                          Hospitals lobbied Perry to veto Miles' management district bill         	2007-07-02	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://www.chron.com//neighborhood/heights-news/article/Hospitals-lobbied-Perry-to-veto-Miles-management-1626825.php	en	governor rick perrys veto on june 15 of a bill that would have expanded the greater southeast management district to include reliant park and other territory south and west of its original boundaries drew a sharp reaction from state representative borris miles ddistrict 146 the bills author its very rare for a governor to veto a local bill miles said adding that it was very obvious that texas orthopedic hospital and other businesses who felt that they didnt want to be a part of the expanded district lobbied perry to veto house bill 4123 former houston city councilwoman helen huey an independent political consultant for hca hospitals confirmed that texas orthopedic hospital and the womans hospital of texas had sent letters urging perry to veto the bill hca hospitals owns both hospitals which are located in the territory that would have been annexed by the management district the districts territory currently includes the greater third ward the museum district the texas medical center the palm center area and more than half of the metro main street rail line nearly identical versions of the hospitals letters were sent by the texas hotel and lodging association and hotels and other businesses that own property within the area that would have been annexed the letters to perry all dated between may 30 and june 5 argued the bill would allow the management district to subject an entire new group of property owners added by this legislation to a special assessment plan without any meaningful recourse other than litigation perry echoed that concern in his message accompanying the veto saying the bill does not allow input from the citizens and property owners of the annexed land being brought into the management district  said jason mclemore the management districts executive director we had no intention of levying an assessment without their input or bringing them in without them knowing if we were to go outside of the districts current boundaries we would have to go through the entire public process involved in the creation of the district again  the letters also said the management district has not historically provided any services or improvements that would benefit the newly impacted business enough to justify the assessments theyd have to pay have they not driven down old spanish trail and almeda lately and seen a difference  miles asked have they not realized that their employees are no longer scared to drive down ost or almeda to get to their place of employment thats because of all the work the management district has done on those streets in those areas  miles said the businesses should have come to him with their concerns before the legislative session ended instead of pushing the veto we could have worked this out we could have had them exempted from the management district he said however the letters said the businesses had no reasonable advance notice of the bill and only learned about it from a local group during the last week of the session susan young president of the nonprofit south main alliance said her organization notified area businesses nonprofits and neighborhood groups about the bills including hb 4123 that affected the area as we would hear that those were put in the hopper or were moving forward  the alliance took no position on the bill but let its members decide whether it was important to them or not she said everyone i communicated with no one had ever heard that this was happening it was a complete surprise  mclemore said the management district provided newspaper notice of the bill but did not contact businesses because we didnt know exactly what was going to get included in the expansion when the bill was filed miles said the hotel industry called his office while he was on the floor of the house and said we object to the bill but did not request a meeting to detail their concerns miles did not specify who had called his office but letters to perry from the texas hotel and lodging association and the hotels said they had voiced our objections to his office to no avail  mclemore said if miles and representative garnet coleman d147 who jointauthored the bill reintroduce similar legislation in a future session i think well definitely do some preliminary work to find out what are the businesses needs and concerns  miles was less conciliatory saying that while i want to work with everybody he was insulted by the businesses lobbying efforts which he said suggested they dont want to be good community partners  in district 146 corporations are going to learn that theyre going to start making deposits in my community and not just withdrawals he said it aint over it aint nowhere near over  for more information about hb 4123 including the bills full text and perrys veto message visit wwwcapitolstatetxus
                          Perry's vetoes of new district boundary bills upset state legislators         	2007-06-30	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://www.chron.com//neighborhood/heights-news/article/Perry-s-vetoes-of-new-district-boundary-bills-1571503.php	en	governor rick perrys vetoes of the expansion of the montrose buffalo bayou and greater southeast management districts have left state legislators and district officials questioning his motives on june 15 perry vetoed  hb 4091 by state representative garnet coleman ddistrict 147 which would have expanded the east montrose management district west to shepherd to encompass all of montrose  hb 4113 by state representative ellen cohen ddistrict 134 and coleman which would have expanded the buffalo bayou management district north of memorial drive to include property within the memorial heights tirz and  hb 4123 by state representative borris miles ddistrict 146 and coleman which would have expanded the greater southeast management district all three had passed several votes in each house almost unanimously each time the bills for the montrose and buffalo bayou districts were supposed to bring those districts back to their initially intended boundaries the buffalo bayou management district was created in the 2003 regular session with sb 1936 and included territory of what are now three management districts  buffalo bayou east montrose and fourth ward in the 2005 regular session coleman said some of the issues with the original buffalo bayou district were corrected with sb 1880 when the fourth ward management district and the east montrose management district were carved out of the buffalo bayou management district territory to form their own districts however coleman has said thenstate representative martha wong rdistrict 134 blocked the western half of montrose from joining east montrose as a united district the bills this session sought to correct the past bills uniting montrose and changing the number of directors of the buffalo bayou board from 31 to nine to more accurately reflect the smaller district the greater southeast district created in the 2001 legislative session also would have grown from its initial boundaries with these management districts when theyre originally created the legislature creates them and they spell out the boundaries as well as the number of board members cesinger said the management districts can change this at the local level by the local government code which provides for this change at the local level  cesinger cited the texas local government code title 12 chapter 375 which discusses the powers of management districts which includes a process for annexing territory changing the districts instead through the legislature she said would take away the input by those governing bodies  this is the part houston legislators disagree with while they acknowledge there is a way for management districts to annex territory and change the board of directors at the local level they also say changing it at the state level does not usurp the local process the next step is getting a petition signed by owners of a majority of the assessed commercial property value with a minimum of 50 owners in support of the district and holding public hearings the buffalo bayou and east montrose districts have not yet gone through the petition process and still would need to do that had the legislation passed the greater southeast district has gone through the petition process but the new territory would have needed to go through that same process before the territory could be added to the district the criteria in the bills we passed for the annexation in those districts is the same criteria used to create a new district coleman said this is where i disagree with the governor the public process is exactly the same the approval by the city is exactly the same and the selection of the board members is exactly the same as the creation of a new district when he talks about usurping the local authority it does not he added it is wrong it is inaccurate he must have been reading another piece of legislation the city testified in favor of the bills  changing the districts through legislation can actually be preferential to the local annexation process coleman said sometimes if youre going out and creating by annexation you dont have a hard and clear boundary he said basically what the governor is arguing is to expand the districts legislatively is not acceptable however creating a whole new district is acceptable with the same thresholds  the legislature did create new management districts this session such as the international management district in alief which perry signed clearly the governor understands the value of creating new districts coleman said state senator rodney ellis dhouston sponsored all three bills in the senate i was very disappointed ellis said i think that management districts do a lot to empower neighborhoods to improve themselves and encourage more economic and cultural development opportunities  if the concerns raised in the veto messages were legitimate concerns he said they should have been raised during the process we never heard a word out of the governors office i think that a few selfserving property owners who wanted to make their money and really didnt give a damn about those neighborhoods contacted the governors office they were afraid to show their faces during the process  coleman said he agrees that someone interfered after the bills were passed and requested a veto moneyed interest contacted the governors office to ask him to veto the bills coleman said its very clear the governors rational just doesnt wash it doesnt fit the facts we told him that the vetoes were obviously not on the merits of the bills  coleman and ellis said these bills arent going away any time soon im a big boy these arent the first bills ive had vetoed coleman said he governor perry can keep his pen handy because hell get the opportunity to veto them again ellis said adding ill make note and return the favor  randall ellis vice chairman of the east montrose board also was disappointed with perrys decision it stands in the way of progress for the montrose neighborhood for businesses for the community and for residents he said we have met we have discussed it and we will look to 2009 for representative coleman to reintroduce that legislation and bring it back to the original intent of what it was when we started this in 2003 and continue to build support from those in west montrose

                          Race may crown Houston's 1st political patrona         	2007-02-12	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://www.chron.com//news/houston-texas/article/Race-may-crown-Houston-s-1st-political-patrona-1555777.php	en	nine months before the city election houston councilwoman carol alvarado and harris county commissioner sylvia garcia are locked in political battle though both deny it and neither will be on the ballot the surface issue is who will succeed the termlimited alvarado representing council district i on the east end the campaigns of james rodriguez alvarados choice and john marron backed by garcia already are busily at work issuing dueling press releases and endorsement lists that typically emerge much later in the political season that is because behindthescenes and with higher stakes the outcome could determine whether one of the women emerges from the fight as the areas first political patrona the woman to know if you aspire to elective office especially in hispanic areas on sylvias part theres always been an element of competitiveness now she just wants to control the politics out in the east end everybodys freaked out by it says longtime political consultant marc campos shes looking to consolidate political power i cant fault her for that  campos admits a bias hes running the campaign of rodriguez who once worked for him alvarado also is a longtime campos client and their friendship dates to when she was a young activist and precinct judge moreover rodriguez was alvarados chief of staff for more than four years and alvarado has an interest in seeing her projects and influence continue whatever her political future it would be advantageous to have an ally on the council term limits put candidates at a disadvantage because it takes two years just to learn your way around city hall in district i we cant afford a twoyear learning curve alvarado says james will hit the ground running he has a good relationship with the mayor and other council members he will not need orientation hell be able to move into the office and continue the progress that i started in district i  sylvia has a right to support who she wants and so do i i just think i have a little more insight into what the needs are in my district  garcia maintains that she is just helping a friend but like alvarado she could gain a loyalist on the council if her candidate wins her highprofile involvement so far includes a letter endorsing marron soon after alvarado wrote one for rodriguez john comes from a family well known in the east end and his family has a long tradition of service marron has the experience and knowledge of the district to serve us well on city council he came and asked me for support said garcia who represents commissioner precinct 2 in east harris county when multiple candidates run for the same seat garcia said it spurs hispanic voters to the ballot box the more hispanics who run the more of us will get elected said garcia who wants to see more people engaged in the political process we have too many occasional voters we need more consistent voters  district i created after a lawsuit forced the council to create singlemember districts mark ed the entry of the hispanic community into elective political power in houston the district has had only three representatives alvarado john castillo and the citys original political patron ben t reyes who later served almost a decade in federal prison on a bribery conviction reyes was elected in 1979 and for a long time was the only hispanic on the council and wielded considerable power his powerbrokering exploits are legendary but times have changed and the district is no longer as docile or monochromatic as it was republican orlando sanchez was elected to a citywide council seat despite strong opposition from the democratic hispanic machine whose grip on hispanic votes even then was loosening he also almost became the first hispanic mayor facing the same opposition former councilman gabriel vasquez similarly and successfully bucked the machine even before voterenacted term limits forced reyes out in 1996 after eight terms his control was unraveling candidates were running and winning without kissing his ring the hispanic political landscape today has changed profoundly becoming diverse unwieldy and probably impossible for any kingmaker to consolidate democratic political consultant dan mcclung who is garcias consultant but is staying neutral in this race likens it to the evolution of black politics in the area when there was only one major leader everybody went to mickey leland mcclung said referring to the congressman who died in a 1989 plane crash as new leaders came along they developed their own turf visibility and profile mcclung said the power is being dispersed and thats a natural occurrence  though marron and rodriguez can put their backers influence to work at some point they will have to start knocking on doors and connecting with voters mcclung said both candidates say they already are rodriguez 31 says he is honored to have alvarados endorsement as her city hall pointman he says he gained an intimate knowledge of the workings of city government and now wants to put it to use i grew up around politics a lot my grandmother on my fathers side was a volunteer at el centro senior center my greatuncles were always involved in political campaigns says rodriguez a lifelong resident of the district ive always had the highest admiration for public servants and always believed in public service  rodriguez grew up in magnolia attended milby high school and graduated from the university of houston marron also was born and raised in the district his father tony marron was a political and civic activist who cut a television commercial for mayor bob lanier during his first race latino votes tipped the scales toward lanier in his defeat of thenmayor kathy whitmire and state representative sylvester turner marron 52 retired three years ago after 30 years with att he is active in the communications workers of america and is an aflcio delegate the latter already has endorsed him for nearly two years he has been a legislative aide for state representative alma allen dhouston marron is steeped in the labor culture and says he wasnt drafted by garcia my dad was always the person that people came to when they wanted to run i know most of the city council the mayor and elected officials in austin and washington dc marron says i started talking about running right after carol got elected last year shes a great lady shes always been our laborendorsed candidate and i campaigned for her but its an open seat and i have the time now to dedicate fully to the community  mcclung calls the race politics at its best but it easily could become politics at its fractious and divisive worst understandably some are wary of wading in and antagonizing alvarado or garcia these things get a little tricky im letting it play out as long as i can mcclung says several other notables also are sitting it out including democratic state sens mario gallegos and john whitmire among the more daring state representatives garnet coleman jessica farrar ana hernandez and dora olivo are backing marron while astros owner drayton mclane former councilman chris bell and state representative borris miles support rodriguez there may be a little bit of wanting to dictate the tempo of politics out in the community campos concludes a bit lorirodriguezchroncom  kristenmackchroncom

CHRONICLE	http://www.chron.com//news/article/Area-s-freshmen-legislators-ready-for-Tuesday-1804183.php	en	a poet said the revolution wont be televised dan patrick can put it on the radio though the republican senatorelect from houstons district 7 who called his victory the start of a revolution broadcasts in two major markets and may add a third that makes the conservative talkshow host the bestknown of the five incoming freshmen in harris countys state legislative delegation as for the harris county state house freshmen two are succeeding representatives who ran unsuccessfully for the senate seat patrick won and two got to the capitol by defeating incumbents new house democrats from harris county are ellen cohen in district 134 and borris miles in district 146 the countys freshman republican representatives are westchase district president jim murphy in district 133 and cardealership owner patricia harless in district 126 patrick is being closely watched statewide because of the reach of his radio stations and his ability to tap into activist conservative listeners he has broadcast locally for several years on ksevam 700 and recently added kmgsam 1160 a dallasarea station he purchased last year patrick says buying the dallas station was driven by business and not politics but some austin politicos fear he will use the medium to disseminate details of private conversations with senate colleagues and to build name recognition for a statewide race people are expecting me to go up there and put on a show patrick said im not going up there to grandstand but to take a stand on the issues i believe in  those issues notably reducing property taxes and securing the border happen to be among the most controversial patrick often is as vocal in going after members of his party for not being conservative enough republicans will hold a 2011 majority in the state senate and patrick says lieutenant governor david dewhurst who presides over the chamber will shoulder much responsibility for its direction will he lead us to the right or to the middle if he leads us to the right i think hell have tremendous support if he leads us to the middle there will be significant opposition patrick said patrick dismisses talk that republicans will respond to his criticism by denying him attractive committee assignments or obstructing his efforts to push major legislation for anyone in the republican party to try and shut me down or the voice of any senate district would not be acceptable he said whether he has a voice in the senate or not hell have one on the airwaves hes already rented studio space across the street from the capitol and expects to broadcast often though not as wellknown as patrick miles also has made a splashy and not entirely favorable impression he caught the attention of some austin lobbyists by hosting a fundraiser there and seeking contributions of as much as 5000 a freshman faux pas we asked for that and we got it miles said and he added that he doesnt think it was a mistake mr miles is coming up here to play im not going to austin to play plantation politics  he spent 985000 to win his seat and now has campaign debt to retire miles also stood out as one of the few freshmen inserted into the middle of the speakers race when he revealed that speaker pro tem sylvester turner dhouston had called him seeking support for speaker tom craddick the speakers race based on a vote of the house involves bluffing gamesmanship and outright misrepresentation about intentions and its generally poor form for a member to say much about it  especially a freshman miles said he makes no apologies he said he had made it clear he would not support craddick and that turner wouldnt have called him if craddick had the race locked up as he has claimed i dont believe in the tactics ive seen and witnessed miles said late last week at the same time miles acknowledges he has some things to learn hindsight tells him that he should have held his cards in the speakers race a little closer to the vest miles says he is paying the way for eight busloads of people from district 146 to witness his swearingin murphy who served nine years on the houston community college board in addition to his leadership of the westchase district in far west houston said he hopes those experiences will give him a leg up in the house they each have a real value in shaping my thinking and determining the way i will operate up there he said harless who was not available for an interview was in austin late last week getting settled in and gearing up for opening day said kindra hefner her political director district 134 is the only local seat to change parties because of cohens decisive win in one of the states few swing districts cohen took a leave of absence from the houston area womens center where she has served 16 years as executive director to run for office two days after the election she was back at work at the nonprofit which helps victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse it is a citizens legislature i want to be able to say if circumstances are right that i can do both jobs she said its important to have people up there who work directly with people who are being affected by laws  since her election she has toured hospitals in the texas medical center which is in district 134 and held a townhall meeting to discuss healthrelated issues tuesdays swearingin holds special significance for cohen it is the fourth anniversary to the day and nearly the hour of her husbands death from cancer life comes full circle she said coincidence is gods way of remaining anonymous  kristenmackchroncom

dhouston state representativeelect borris miles dhouston and state sens mario gallegos dhouston and rodney ellis dhouston say they are ready to work we could possibly go to a needsbased system as opposed to a lottery system talton said the lottery system has caused a concentration of affordable housing apartment complexes in pockets of the state  talton prefiled one bill  house bill 235  in november the bill states that a taxexempt charitable organization that provides lowincome or moderateincome housing may not be exempt from property taxes after jan 1 2008 unless the organization received a property tax exemption in 2007 it is important for us to be truthful in dealing with the dropout rate noriega said it does not matter whether it is 30 40 or 50 percent  all of those are too high if we do not accurately diagnose the problem then we cannot apply remedies to fix it  noriega said he is supportive of measures to maximize the federal contribution to the states childrens health insurance program chip and homeland security issues some legislators have spoken out against a program requirement to reenroll children every six months because it forces many out of the program also the fewer children enrolled in the program the lower the federal governments monetary match for the program allen prefiled four bills in december two of the four affect public schools house bill 379 proposed to abolish corporal punishment in texas public schools allen said houston schools do not allow corporal punishment but there are pockets of public schools across the state that allow that practice we want our schools to be positive safe places allen said house bill 215 amends the education code to require that each female pupil enrolling in sixth grade be fully immunized against the human papilloma virus or hpv the education code already provides for diphtheria rubeola rubella mumps tetanus and poliomyelitis immunizations individuals charged with an offense related to prostitution would be required to undergo aids hiv infection and other related testing according to farrars house bill 292 the test results would be shared with the persons spouse or partner house bill 215 requires that school district enroll no more than 18 students in a prekindergarten class one bill would restore the former boundaries of the greater southeast management district coleman said a bill backed by former state representative al edwards dhouston removed parts of both house members districts from the entity coleman said he and state representativeelect borris miles dhouston would author that legislation miles beat out edwards for the district 146 seat in the democratic primary runoff election last april coleman said would also file legislation that promotes alternative energy sources such as solar energy and would work to restore and expand the chips program hernandez said she wants to work on companion legislation to gallegos air quality bill which had been one of morenos priorities a lot of our focus will be on that bill said hernandez a former aide to moreno and state representative jessica farrar its an important issue and a big issue  last session house bill 2972 which was coauthored by moreno and farrar and also dealt with monitoring and controlling emissions of air contaminants didnt make it out of the environmental regulation committee another issue hernandez said she wants to work on is the childrens health insurance program regarding control of air contaminants gallegos said he would work with small chemical companies along the ship channel to garner support for the bill gallegos said he anticipated taking some bills to the legislature on behalf of the port of houston authority but he didnt know the details yet he also said he planned to confer with local community college officials about construction needs that could be paid for with tuition revenue bonds such bonds must be approved by the legislature i believe these measures are largely responsible for the estimated 37000 children in harris county who have been taken off the chip rolls since september 2003 ellis said ellis supports 12 months continuous eligibility for chip participants the legislature must ensure quality monitoring of the new eligibility system so children are not needlessly denied access to the health care they need and deserve ellis said he said he would file legislation to raise the minimum wage in texas the minimum wage is at its lowest point in 50 years when adjusted for inflation and is failing to keep up with the rising costs of health care energy and education ellis said he said he would also work to protect the state against the harmful health risks associated with pollution the dangers of secondhand smoke and the skyrocketing prices

political operative who beat veteran lawmaker al edwards by energetically exploiting his political weak spots miles 40 represents a new generation of black democratic elected officials in houston he first considered challenging edwards four years ago last june miles drove to austin to meet with the legislator but ended up waiting in his office for hours edwards refused to meet with him miles said and that was when he decided to run he asked if i could stand down and give him one more term miles said of a later conversation with edwards but i had to do it it was just my time  although he faces a libertarian opponent in the nov 7 general election miles is the strong favorite to assume the district 146 seat next january first on his list for the district which includes the third ward and sunnyside is setting up a functional district office instead of one he said edwards maintains with an answering machine miles admits he can be ostentatious sporting custommade suits and gucci shoes he threw his 40th birthday party at the rice lofts last year where the theme was fantastic voyage and the group lakeside performed its classic song but he also used that charm on the campaign trail gaining votes by serving people breakfast in an apron at community forums edwards first elected in 1978 is best known for making juneteenth a state holiday al edwards style and work was fine for another era said state representative garnet coleman who has had differences with edwards for several years and supported miles and at that time he had the interest and needs of folks in poor conditions at the end he was voting republican house speaker tom craddicks interests and thats the disconnect he betrayed whatever principles he had previously in protecting peoples civil rights  that edwards drew two credible challengers was a sign that he was in trouble coleman said lawyer al bennett placed third in the march democratic primary in a district where roots are important miles let it be known that he was homegrown he grew up in sunnyside and is a lifelong resident of the district miles attended yates high school and graduated from the houston high school for law enforcement then earned a degree in criminal justice from sam houston state university in 1996 miles started his oneman insurance agency operation in his garage apartment he has since purchased and renovated two city blocks on almeda where he leases space to seven other businesses miles has been laying the groundwork for this run for years he has been active in several civic organizations among them the urban league united negro college fund and 100 black men of houston and hes been active in the politics for the past two decades contributing on both sides of the aisle miles gave democratic state representative sylvester turner several thousand in his 2003 mayoral campaign he donated 2500 to republican governor rick perry in 2004 and 2100 to republican us senator kay bailey hutchison last year miles also drove turner around town during his 1991 mayoral race yet turner backed edwards candidacy edwards had the support of some democratic establishment stalwarts including us representatives al green and sheila jackson lee and the rev william lawson pastor emeritus of wheeler avenue baptist church but lawsons wife audrey and current wheeler avenue pastor marcus cosby backed morris campaign thats how miles garnered support aiming for those who werent obligated to edwards because of past ties and relationships most of houstons democratic state house delegation backed miles candidacy including coleman and state representatives alma allen jessica farrar ana hernandez and rick noriega craig washington a former state representative senator and congressman who represented parts of district 146 in each job but who has kept a low profile since losing his us house seat to jackson lee in 1994 emerged to endorse miles ive stayed out of elections because i returned to being a voter and consider myself a bystander washington said but i felt compelled to get involved in this election when i saw a person who was not articulating and advocating on behalf of the people of the district representative edwards lost the ability to be an effective leader  it wasnt so much that he supported miles but that he opposed edwards washington said i would have supported whoever was in the runoff washington said its time for a fresh voice to put a fresh horse on the track  the people who signed onto his campaign are the political laborers of the community miles said we shared a common agenda they are in the trenches these are the working politicians not the people who sit high and look low they are actively involved miles said coleman says miles is successful because of his work ethic he demonstrated that hes a hard worker coleman said he has a tenacity and vigilance thats needed for the district and on the floor of the house  kristenmackchroncom

trying to legislate corporal punishment for drug dealers and limits on provocative cheerleading but in his early days he was one of houstons civil rights pioneers who marched alongside the rev martin luther king jr and sponsored the law that made juneteenth a state holiday edwards was upbeat wednesday the day after businessman borris l miles ousted him in the democratic runoff for house district 146 edwards who will leave the legislature in january said he will continue working on issues that have always been dear to him including education and neighborhood improvements i was involved in the community before i was in the legislature i was involved while i was in and i will still be involved now that i am not said edwards the legislature is not the beginning or the end of life ive walked many a mile in the halls of the state capitol and i intend to keep walking in them just in a different capacity  edwards was the sixth of 16 children and the son of a minister he attended phyllis wheatley high school and received a bachelors degree from texas southern university in 1966 he joined his father in the ministry in 1993 and is member of progressive new hope church as a young man he was immersed in the civil rights movement marching and demonstrating throughout the country and rubbing elbows with the stalwarts king civil rights leader jesse jackson former cleveland mayor carl stokes and houstons own the rev william lawson protested discrimination alongside him i supported al in the election weve been friends for a long time and during my times as president of the houston naacp whenever there was a call to arms al was always there said longtime naacp leader howard jefferson whenever the community has a problem the one person you can expect to be there is al  when he was elected to the state house from the district that includes the third ward and sunnyside edwards promptly introduced a bill making june 19 a state holiday today he still is best known as the father of juneteenth which commemorates the date in 1865 when texas slaves received word of the emancipation proclamation that freed them despite making his mark early and staunchly supporting a democratic agenda he increasingly was viewed as a maverick who was out of step with more hardline party regulars edwards drew national attention including considerable ridicule with legislation that came to be known as the booty bill which would have banned overly suggestive cheerleading routines the house passed the bill but it died in the senate besides sometimes rolling their eyes at edwards legislative proposals including another one that called for amputating drug dealers fingers critics believed he was too cozy with the republican legislative leadership he was criticized for not joining democrats when they bolted to oklahoma three years ago to break quorum in an ultimately failed attempt to block a gopfriendly congressional redistricting plan edwards defends his record lets not be petty people carry legislation they believe in and if others dont want to vote for it thats fine somebody has to look out for our children he says of the cheerleader proposal of staying behind during redistricting he says he remained in austin to work on other legislation but made a point of not being on the floor when redistricting was considered sylvia brooks the longtime chief executive officer and president of the houston area urban league supported miles who is a wellknown businessman and civic activist it wasnt that i opposed him so much as i supported borris but borris had asked for my support a long time ago not just in this particular race but as a mentor she said with edwards incumbency came longterm relationships with houstons black leaders several of whom endorsed his reelection they didnt just lend their names but they cut radio ads and circulated automaticdialed phone calls throughout the district state representative sylvester turner dhouston block walked for edwards and served as a surrogate at sunday church appearances he also contributed more than 6000 to edwards campaign us representative al green dhouston also backed edwards and recalled how they both fought against community landfills and a host of police brutality cases where persons were harmed under questionable circumstances  i remember him then as i remember him now as a person who was of the community and for the community green said hes been involved and engaged in trying to make a difference with the times that weve had  having said that green added that it is time to mend fences i think that campaigns are such that when they are overtry to do what you can to heal and move forward this one is over now the people have spoken green said i commend al edwards and congratulate borris miles and

NEWS	http://watchdogblog.dallasnews.com/2015/02/out-of-state-out-of-luck-restraint-on-outside-access-to-public-info-among-new-open-records-bills.html/	en	senator john whitmire left talks to lieutenant governor dan patrick center and senator kevin eltife after new rules were adopted jan 21 in the senate chamber at the capitol in austin eltife authored changes that led to elimination of the state senates open government committee alongside three others interest in prioritizing open government may wax and wane in the state legislature but as the first month of the legislative session draws to a close a host of bills offered by lawmakers could impact the reach of the states sunshine law the texas public information act while most of those bills seek to carve out exceptions to disclosure in other laws some legislators have proposed revisions to the public information act to change who is entitled to receive open records and what they are able to obtain state representative mike schofield rkaty offered a bill feb 4 that would allow government entities to refuse service to those who do not live in texas schofield said the bill is meant to clarify the public information act which he said has no guts  it would sharpen the acts language to let public employees know to whom they must answer  and make clear which requests records custodians may ignore this is a simple bill to say texas government is responsive to texans schofield said the bill was prompted in part by schofields experience working as counsel and adviser to former governor rick perry whose office he said fielded numerous requests from outside individuals that would take it upon themselves to decide that they were the lead person on some area of texas government  time spent on those requests should instead be devoted to helping texans he said schofield said newsgathering originating from other states should not be impacted by a change to the law pointing to reporting on former virginia governor bob mcdonnells corruption scandal and subsequent prosecution schofield cited that states transparency law as an example of a successful open records act with language that limits rights to those inside the state in my experience most outside reporters call people for interviews he said while the bill does not mandate refusal of service to those outside the state it does allow records custodians to ask for proof of primary residency in texas before they decide to provide public information if it isnt offered up the records custodian has the discretion to put the request aside unless outofstate requesters can find another person living in texas to obtain the information they may be out of luck theyre not entitled to command it schofield said other lawmakers are seeking to rework portions of the public information act to widen the reach of the law in criminal justice matters information about official oppression complaints against police officers could become public under a bill offered by state representative borris miles dhouston miles first filed an iteration of the bill in 2011 after video surfaced of houston teen chad holley  then a 15yearold burglary suspect  being beaten by police officers this session miles said he believes there is a groundswell of support for the bill on the heels of officerinvolved deaths across the us including the cases of michael brown eric garner and tamir rice 12 who was fatally shot by cleveland police in november though miles bill targets police departments in cities with a population of 2 million or more people he said he hopes it would later apply to smaller municipalities miles who once worked in law enforcement said hes sensitive to concerns that illfounded retaliatory complaints against police officers might become public but retention policies in some police departments dont always provide for keeping complaints on file unless an officer has been found guilty of a crime he said how many complaints do come in that we dont know that a police officer has received  that may have some truth to them that may have some validity to them  miles said it can show a past history of abuse  under legislation proposed by state senator john whitmire dhouston information about private university police at schools such as smu would be subject to disclosure under the texas public information act state senator john whitmire dhouston chairman of the senates criminal justice committee has also filed a bill to make private university campus police departments subject to the public information act the move came in response to a 2013 incident involving rice university campus police officers who were filmed using batons to beat a suspected bicycle thief a harris county grand jury later chose not to indict the officers when we asked for the investigation information the incident report and even a video they said they were not covered by open records laws whitmire said and we said no the state licenses and certifies your peace officers state senator van taylor rplano and representative jason villalba rdallas have filed the private school marshall act which provides for armed guards on campus the act would make the identity of those guards confidential under open records law state representative debbie riddle rspring a bill and amendment to the state constitution offered by state representative debbie riddle rspring would remove the states public integrity unit from the travis county district attorneys office to place it under the jurisdiction of the attorney general the filings were made in reaction to a travis county grand jurys indictment of former governor rick perry last summer on felony charges of abuse of official capacity and coercion of a public servant the charges came after perry threatened to veto funding for the unit unless travis county district attorney rosemary lehmberg offered her resignation following a drunkdriving arrest information provided by law enforcement officials to the public integrity unit is confidential under riddles bill while the open records law exempts most investigatory materials from disclosure it lists a completed report audit evaluation or investigation made of for or by a governmental body as examples of whats informally known as super public information a call to riddles office to determine the intended scope of the bills confidentiality provision was not returned last month the dallas morning news published the results of a yearlong investigation into compliance with the states open records law among 113 government agencies in north texas the

In Report, University History Departments Face Scrutiny	2013-01-10	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2013/01/10/university-history-departments-focus-new-report/	en	at a press conference on thursday afternoon three conservative groups  the texas public policy foundation the national association of scholars and the texas association of scholars  will release a suretobe controversial report alleging that the university of texas and texas am university offer students a lessthancomprehensive picture of history  the reports rollout is part of a threeday policy orientation by the tppf an austinbased think tank that has been tied to some of the states most hotly debated proposed higher education reforms it signals a renewed push to reconsider the course offerings in the history departments of the states public universities and particularly to boost the number of courses dedicated to the study western civilization jeremi suri a prominent historian at ut who has already read the report called it disappointing i have a lot of respect for the national association of scholars he said they spend a lot of time defending free speech and im a big believer in free speech but this report is just so off base its just not accurate  written by richard fonte the former director of the we the people program at the national endowment for the humanities the study examined the background of professors and the syllabi for 85 courses offered in the fall of 2010 that could have counted toward the states requirement that students at public institutions take two american history classes we found that all too often the course readings gave strong emphasis to race class and gender social history an emphasis so strong that it diminished the attention given to other subjects in american history such as military diplomatic religious intellectual history fonte wrote he contended that the prevalence of rcg  race class and gender  assignments was more of an issue at ut than at am he determined that too many courses were highly specialized and also noted that major historical figures were being overlooked at both universities with only rare mentions of ralph waldo emerson john dewey alexander graham bell thomas a edison the wright brothers or the scientists of the manhattan project  thomas lindsay the director of the tppfs center for higher education said in a statement that his organization is pleased to be a part of launching this study which will help universities and administrators to return to teaching american history in its fullness  strengthening the teaching of american history government and western civilization is at the very core of our recommendations for reform he added in december lindsay was among the authors of a tppf report that suggested that university regents and other administrators should be encouraged to institute reforms that place more focus on teaching students basic american history government economics and western civilization whether through a standardized test or more course optionsrequirements  this new report recommends that the universities have their curriculum reviewed hire new faculty members with broader interests make sure survey courses remain broad in scope and depoliticize history  the report will be given to the leadership at the universities we hope that they will read it and consider it instead of judging it without reading it said ashley thorne director for the study of the curriculum at the national association of scholars she acknowledged that the group is accustomed to taking controversial stances including a strong opposition to affirmative action which ut recently defended before the us supreme court suri said the ut history program has a strong emphasis in military political and diplomatic history some on the left argue its too strong he added suri author of libertys surest guardian american nationbuilding from the founders to obama said that departmental focus was one of the primary reasons he came to ut he said the report makes no mention of a new university center focused on diplomacy and national security or of the normandy scholars program which offers students an intense focus on world war ii and is one of uts signature offerings there is political correctness in the academic world and academics  like people in any field  tend to follow fashions and trends and sometimes thats a problem he said but thats not a problem with the teaching of history in this department they just chose the wrong thing  fonte said he anticipated that the university would defend itself against his findings and acknowledged that the report makes assumptions about courses based on their assigned readings suri argues that an accurate understanding of the nature of a course requires more involvement than merely a review of the syllabus from a single semester come sit in come engage us if you really care suri said extending the same invitation to curious legislators anxiety about the history curriculum at texas public universities is nothing new for state legislators one of the most memorable debates on the house floor during the 82nd legislative session occurred when state representative wayne christian rcenter proposed an amendment requiring that universities dedicate 10 percent of their courses to instruction in western civilization  the amendment failed in part because of his inability to articulate his motivation for offering it when representative borris miles dhouston pressed him on what he meant by western civilization christian provided the following response   similarly frustrated with christians responses to questions about whether the abolitionist movement or native american studies would be included in the requirement state representative rafael anchia ddallas publicly speculated that the motivation behind the amendment was very political and potentially insulting and argued that ut and other universities should be free from this type of manipulation and political statement on the house floor  christian will not be returning this session he lost his bid for reelection but thursdays press conference is a strong indication that his proposal  or something resembling it  might lindsay told the texas tribune that he did not think the discussion should be as contentious as it was in the previous session this transcends any party differences he said democracy is not a gift its something that each generation has to earn and the current generation must teach to the up and coming generation  as for race class and gender both lindsay and fonte said those topics should be taught but with less of an emphasis than they believe currently exists those are all aspects of american history lindsay said students

Miles, Edwards Face Off for Fourth Time 	2012-05-25	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2012/05/25/ding-ding-round-4-borris-vs-al-grudge-match/	en	houston  state representative borris miles practically leaps into the conference room at the anna dupre apartments in innercity houston the residents council meeting has already started you gonna give me some sugar he says to an elderly woman on his way into the dingy room she promptly kisses him on the cheek the democratic incumbent solicits their concerns and dutifully listens as the women many in wheelchairs fill him in they want a new roof for a bus stop their nonprofit paperwork is a mess and the cars drive too fast on the boulevard out front is that it  he asks anything else  silence miles tells the gathering that the roof and the paperwork wont be a problem the traffic might be beyond his control though and he reminds them that he doesnt like to promise things he cant deliver they all nod alright yall know we got an election coming up  miles asks he holds up a sample mailin ballot and explains the procedures before warning them not to let others fill out the forms for them then he acknowledges the elephant in the room and at least part of the reason he is working his tail off right now hes got an opponent the same one he had last time and the time before that just cause i got elected dont mean im gonna turn my back on ya he said but i need your help now im getting tired of foolin with al edwards  the crowd bursts in laughter theyre kind of sick of the al vs borris grudge match too its comical for outsiders but the ritualistic feud between the two democrats feels more like a recurring nightmare to whoever the incumbent happens to be and that title keeps changing when their fight began a few years ago the incumbent was edwards a civil rights activist and lay minister who was first elected to the texas house in 1978 now 75 edwards is perhaps best known for legislation making juneteenth a state holiday it commemorates june 19 1865 the day slaves in texas learned they had been freed edwards other signature effort legislation aimed at banning raunchy cheerleader routines in public schools drew national headlines in 2005 but the socalled booty bill died in the senate after narrowly passing the house when the next election rolled around in 2006 edwards pointed with pride to his highprofile committee assignments including his service on the powerful house appropriations committee but miles a former cop and wealthy businessman said edwards had strayed far from his democratic roots and hadnt done enough for their impoverished district south of downtown houston he tagged edwards as a craddick d meaning he was a democrat tapped to join the inner circle of former house speaker tom craddick rmidland miles easily won in a runoff that year and he seemed to have strong prospects heading into his reelection battle after the 2007 legislative session his fortunes dimmed considerably though after allegations surfaced that miles had crashed a christmas party brandished a derringer pistol and made threats  calling himself a gangsta  before kissing another mans wife on the lips the controversy was hanging over miles during the 2008 elections and this time it was edwards accusing the incumbent who has a penchant for wearing custommade suits and driving foreign cars of losing touch with the district edwards easily trounced his opponent and returned to the legislature the allegations against miles soon blossomed into a felony indictment and two charges of deadly conduct miles hired famed defense attorney rusty hardin to represent him and he hotly denied the accusations he said the whole thing was cooked up by edwards supporters desperate to take him down at the 2009 trial hardin showed the jury a blownup photo featuring a wine glass in miles hand he said miles could not have been holding a gun as witnesses had claimed and the jury agreed miles who says he spent 400000 defending himself felt both vindicated and angry he again challenged edwards in 2010 and he won in a nailbiter  11 votes later reduced to eight after a recount the way miles sees it the grudge should have ended right there he says he has tried to reach out to edwards to bury the hatchet and work together for the good of the district why cant he just let it go  miles asked in a telephone interview edwards said that if he were motivated by selfinterest he wouldnt run again his 30 years of service make him eligible for a pension of more than 86000 a year and hell have to give that up and start drawing 600 a month as a parttime legislator if he wins but he said the district is awash in problems  drug abuse unemployment underfunded schools  and he wants to put his long years of experience back to use seniority is what counts when you want to get on some of these powerful committees he said why give away all this power that district 146 has accumulated through me to someone who has been there for such a short period  miles 46 concedes that he doesnt have the seniority that edwards accumulated over decades in the legislature but he said edwards wasted it on foolish endeavors like the booty bill and a a botched effort to put a juneteenth statue on the grounds of the state capitol in austin the veteran lawmaker fought for the monument for years only to see the plans get engulfed in controversy after one of the central figures carved for the bronze statue was a dead ringer for edwards himself according to media reports the statue is still sitting in the basement of a bastrop foundry while there are plenty of controversies for each candidate to exploit their differences are largely stylistic theyre both democrats who want more money for their district from a state controlled by tightfisted republicans what isnt clear in a delayed primary with no presidential election to drive up turnout is who will show up at the polls after getting a good pair of shoes with some support in the middle and pounding the pavement to get out the vote edwards says he feels good about his chances miles sees the 2008 election when barack obama and hillary clinton drove turnout through the roof as an anomaly i feel a lot better this time he said were gonna blow al out of the way it aint even gonna be close  texas tribune donors or members may be quoted or

Bill Would Untangle Hair Braiding Regulations	2015-04-06	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2015/04/06/bill-would-untangle-messy-hair-care-regulations/	en	isis brantley has been practicing the art of african hair braiding professionally in dallas for more than 30 years she started braiding music star erykah badus hair when badu was 9 years old and shes shared her craft with hundreds of others including teaching welfare recipients to braid as a path out of poverty the state of texas has fought brantley every step of the way insisting she comply with barbering regulations that have no bearing on her work and arresting her when she tried to open a dallas salon brantley was in austin on monday for the start of what she hopes will be the last chapter of that decadeslong battle  im asking the government to get out of the way so i can teach the next generation of hair braiders and earn an honest living she said a federal court in january ruled that texas laws restricting brantleys ability to open a hair braiding school were unconstitutional state lawmakers are now considering legislation to drop restrictions on the hair braiding industry altogether the house licensing and administrative procedures committee heard testimony monday from brantley and her attorney on house bill 2717 by state representative craig goldman rfort worth which would exempt braiders from having to obtain a cosmetology license to practice their trade texas law requires extensive training and basic minimum facilities for licensed barbers and cosmetologists those requirements extend to hair braiders even though braiders do not use chemicals tools barber chairs or sinks brantley told the committee that like most braiders she doesnt even use scissors or combs  just her hands licensing should be reserved for occupations that have a real and substantial safety problem or interest said arif panju an attorney with the institute for justice representing brantley goldmans bill would exempt braiders from all barbering and cosmetology requirements ironically for a licensed hair braider the barbering and cosmetology schools they must attend do not teach hair braiding nor are there continuing education courses for hair braiding offered in the state of texas goldman told the committee he called the regulations onerous and unnecessary  since brantley dropped out of college in 1980 and began braiding hair for a living those regulations have made it difficult for her  and braiders across texas  to practice her trade openly brantley started her business in her kitchen away from the eyes of state regulators after 12 years she tried to open a salon as soon as i opened up the shop wow the red tape was wrapped around my hands she said seven cops came in in front of my clients and arrested me and took me to jail like a common criminal the crime was braiding without a cosmetology license  brantley spent much of the next decade challenging hair braiding restrictions in court in 2007 the 1500hour training requirement for braiders to receive a cosmetology license was dropped to 35 hours and brantley was grandfathered in and awarded a license isis said this is perfectly safe we dont need a license we dont want a license panju said barbering and cosmetology really is the pinnacle of how occupational licensing has reached such an extent that its now stifling entrepreneurs  brantley won the right to braid hair but her legal battle with the state wasnt over she had already taught hundreds of others to braid and in 2013 she tried to start teaching formal classes in her shop but state regulators told brantley she needed 2250 hours of instruction and a 2000squarefoot facility to open a barber school once again she was told she would have to buy barber chairs and wash stations that arent necessary for braiding hair in accordance with texas barbering administrative rules devised for professional barber schools so brantley sued the texas department of licensing and regulation arguing that the requirements to open a school violated her 14th amendment equal protection rights by preventing her and those who wanted to learn from her from earning an honest living in january 2015 a us district court in austin sided with brantley and struck down the training and equipment requirements to open a braiding school during the trial panju said the state couldnt identify a single hair braiding school that was able to open under the strict requirements the ruling makes it crystal clear to the legislature that whats happening here is nothing to do with public health and safety and everything to do with economic protectionism panju said at the committee meeting state representative borris miles dhouston apologized to brantley on behalf of the state of texas  vice chairman roland gutierrez dsan antonio said he supported goldmans bill wholeheartedly but emphasized the need for regulating other barbering and cosmetology businesses no one at the hearing testified against the bill brantley said regulations on the hair braiding industry are a major roadblock to the upward mobility of the impoverished community where the art of african hair braiding is most prevalent brantley said shes helped poor dallas residents open their own braiding businesses feed their families and clothe their children thats the american dream that i want to be a part of brantley said cut the red tape help people learn this art and go to work  our daily news summary

Technicality Slays House Bill on Class Sizes  for Now	2011-04-26	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2011/04/26/technicality-slays-house-bill-on-class-sizes-now/	en	the house was set to debate a bill that would scrap a 27yearold law mandating a 22to1 studentteacher ratio in kindergarten through fourth grade today  but before it got the chance state representative borris miles dhouston derailed the legislation with a point of order hb 400 from state representative rob eissler rwoodlands would replace that ratio with a hard cap of 25 students per classroom miles challenged the bill because the analysis did not match up with the text of the bill it now returns to the public education committee which eissler chairs which must pass it out once again it could hit the house floor for the second time as early as friday in an interview after his point of order was sustained miles called eliminating the class size ratio ridiculous and said that it pitted teachers against administrators he said that when it returned to the floor he would continue to challenge it theres other points of order on hb 400 that need to be addressed he said outside the house chambers eissler emphasized that his bill was about protecting teachers jobs and expressed frustration that it had been delayed on a technicality were in the catandmouse game now that should tell you how badly they dont want this to pass he said in 1984 the legislature passed an extensive school reform package which included a requirement that prohibited schools from going above a 22to1 studenttoteacher ratio in elementary grades teachers associations have fought hard to keep that in place saying the detriment to students educational experience that removing the ratio would bring isnt worth what they believe will be a marginal benefit they also question whether it would actually help reduce costs districts can already apply for a waiver if they lack the space or qualified teachers to create a new class  and they say the texas education agency already grants the vast majority of such requests eisslers bill also contains provisions that eliminate minimum salary requirements for teachers authorizes unpaid furloughs and removes the 30day period for districts to notify teachers of their termination it also does away with the 10to1 student teacher ratio for remedial classes in the upper chamber state senator dan patrick rhouston has similar legislation pending in committee sb 443 changes the 22to1 class size cap to a 21to1 districtwide average it prohibits districts from having any class sizes larger than 24  and does not provide a waiver texas tribune donors or members may be quoted or mentioned in our stories or may be the subject of them for a complete list of contributors click here our daily news summary
In the Thick of It	2011-04-11	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2011/04/11/in-the-thick-of-it/	en	the first half of a legislative session is for building the relationships that get destroyed in the second half of the session the second half is underway not that any fights are breaking out but the house went cumulatively more than 24 hours on the budget in a debate that had its moments western civilization anyone and produced a little tension and a miserly budget that cant pass the state senate redistricting was already under way but only on state board of education maps thats like riding with training wheels but now theyve graduated to talking about congressional maps two lawsuits have been filed  one in north texas where former republican legislator ron clark is now a federal judge and another in hidalgo county where theres also litigation pending over the countys allegations that the census left as many as 200000 people uncounted travis county wants a congressional district that begins and ends in travis county a new group called the texas latino redistricting task force presented two maps and argued that two of the four new congressional districts in texas ought to be latinomajority districts and maybe three of them the senate is still scraping for money to try to lessen budget cuts committees are in full swing the house is meeting on fridays now this is the fun part right texas senators scratching for new state revenue canceled a meeting to talk about their options but a copy of their list got loose and it includes 55 billion in taxes fees asset sales and accounting tricks that could be used to ease their budget problems if that is the proposed cures are more politically palatable than the budget cuts the list was obtained by empower texans a group that advocates for fiscal conservatism and posted on its website senator robert duncan rlubbock has been leading the effort to find 5 billion or more in nontax revenues and confirmed the lists authenticity but he says not everything on the list printed at the beginning of the week is still under consideration he wouldnt get specific though nobodys saying you can do this or you should do this he says this is just a list of things to consider  duncan has a markedup version he wont share because he says he hasnt put together a senate consensus thats why he canceled his subcommittees meeting today he had planned to put out his list today at the committee meeting but wants another week or so to talk to senators asked if his version differs from the earlier version that got leaked he says its very safe to say that  and he says he wasnt the leaker i was surprised it was out but it doesnt matter he says this is a little like the old days of the texas performance review when someone had the job of coming to the budget party with a list of fundraising tricks that wouldnt leave political scars except that some of these would especially if they can fairly be labled as taxes the inventory of ideas as duncan calls it is part of the senates attempt to find nontax revenue to ease coming cuts in the state budget the house approved a twoyear budget on sunday that totals 1645 billion  about 23 billion less than the current budget and a drop of about 123 percent in spending the senates version hasnt been voted out of the finance committee yet while its smaller than the current budget its cuts are not as deep as those in the house edition some of the big items on the duncan panels list many of which are onetime measures   200 million from counting the balances in the texas enterprise and emerging technology funds against spending to balance the budget  78 million from shortening the time the state holds unclaimed property allowing them to count those assets  which can still be claimed by texans  against the budget  216 million from moving up the date when businesses turn over unclaimed property to the state  111 million from tying the backtoschool sales tax holiday to economic conditions and canceling it in hard times  267 million from speeding up collection of motor fuel and diesel taxes  666 million by accelerating collection of alcohol taxes  47 million from cutting the tax stamp discount for cigarette distributors  200 million from ending the sales tax exemption for blue cross on taxable items bought under federal contracts  3248 million from ending the sales tax exemption for contract computer programming  596 million for ending the 20 percent sales tax exemption for data processing services  590 million from moving tobacco permanent health funds set aside in a tobacco lawsuit settlement in the 1990s from a dedicated account into a general revenue account another 379 million would come from doing the same thing with the permanent public health fund  853 million by capping the savings retailers get for paying sales taxes on time  1153 million by collecting a surcharge when texans buy fuelinefficient vehicles  1024 million by assessing satellite tv providers with a subscription video assessment already paid by cable companies  243 million from more highcost gas audits  426 million by suspending the highcost gas exemption for two years a measure that would also add 6336 million to the rainy day fund  111 million by releasing 3000 prison inmates who are nonviolent eligible for parole and who would be immediately deported  75 million by releasing 1000 elderly prison inmates under supervision for serious medical conditions  505 million from increasing state traffic fines to 45 from 30  300 million from accelerating sales tax collections from monthly payers  128 million by repealing the timely filer discount for fuel taxpayers  94 million by improving administration of the texas economic development cap  334 million by ending the sales tax exemption on rolling stock and locomotives  888 million to 19 billion by spending up collections of quarterly state business franchise taxes  677 million from eliminating the states texas boll weevil eradication fund the public version of drawing new congressional maps for texas started with committee hearings and the unveiling of a proposal from a coalition that wants at least two of the four new districts to have latino majorities the chairmen of the senate and house committees that will draw those and other maps meanwhile both say theyll be trying to draw new maps that are fair that are legal and that make the greatest number of legislators happy the process wont be driven by assertion or insistence but by the numbers said senator kel seliger ramarillo at an event sponsored by the texas tribune he said the hispanic growth in the state is undeniable but said that population is diffused throughout the state it isnt always easy to draw districts for a population thats scattered throughout the state and not bunched in particular neighborhoods and geographic communities representative burt solomons rcarrollton and the head of the house redistricting committee echoed that theres been a lot of hispanic growth in the state but theyre not all in one place  both said theyre trying to get maps drawn with as little political violence as possible but there will be blood they admit theres going to be some very happy people solomons said theres going to be a few very unhappy people my job is make sure i have as few unhappy people as possible  texas is getting four new seats in congress because of its rapid growth over the last decade and since twothirds of that growth was hispanic a coalition called the texas latino redistricting task force says at least two of the new districts should have hispanic majorities almost twothirds of the states growth over the last ten years was hispanic and hispanics now account for 38 percent of the texas population the group said they presented two maps each of which includes nine latinomajority seats thats two more than in the current 32 districts and the new seats would go in the dallasfort worth metroplex and in starr and western hidalgo counties in the rio grande valley several members of the task force said theyd like to see another latino seat and jose cardenas president of the league of united latin american citizens or lulac said his group is trying to draw a map that would create four new latino seats in texas one idea would create a latino district that includes part of southeastern travis county and reaches down to south san antonio the task force includes the mexican american legal defense and education fund maldef lulac the american gi forum the san antonio hispanic chamber of commerce and the southwest voter registration education project those groups will be involved both individually and as a group in the legislative lobbying and in the inevitable court fights over the maps that emerge from the legislative session the timing is tied to house committee hearings on the congressional districts that began this week those maps  along with ideas from other groups that want a say in congressional redistricting  will go into testimony as legislators draw 36 new congressional districts each with exactly 698488 people in it state lawmakers began hearing from a long line of interest groups members of congress and people representing them partisans and others on their way to drawing new maps the house panel already voted out new maps for the state board of education still ahead in addition to the congressional maps are maps for representatives and senators both seliger and solomons are accepting ideas from other members and hoping that local lawmakers can work out some of the local fights in dallas county for instance there are 16 state representatives and only enough people probably for 14 two are in trouble solomons admitted at the triblive conversation that some of the four freshmen lawmakers in that county probably have reason to be nervous in west texas the area that stretches from the panhandle to the mexican border and from el paso county in the west to i35 in the east has 18 state representatives and only enough people probably for 16 warren chisum rpampa has already indicated he wont seek reelection so theres one but somebody else might be in trouble the senate has bigger districts but the geographic and population problems are the same seliger said the west texas districts will have to find people in the i35 corridor to bring their numbers in line the populations of the current districts are too small given the growth of the state since they were drawn in 2001 asked about the conventional wisdom that it will be hard to protect all 101 republicans in the texas house from politically hazardous maps solomons admitted its a problem i think its really really difficult to draw a legal map at 101 solomons said you can technically draw one  likewise seliger said its possible to draw maps that put republicans in control of twothirds of the senate seats they have 19 now and would need 21 to make two thirds thats going to be challenging he said democrat wendy davis of fort worth has argued that hers is a protected coalition district but seliger said hes not sure thats right shes at some risk he said i wont say shes toast but given the composition of her district shes going to be challenged  there will be a lot of pressure from people in the republican party to try and do something there he added i dont know what were going to do  partisans are interested in those congressional seats too members of the congressional delegation are talking amongst themselves and two lamar smith rsan antonio and henry cuellar dlaredo floated the idea a year ago of splitting the four new seats between the two big political parties that was before the elections that swept democrats out of seats in the delegation and in the legislature but seliger said democrats absolutely have a fair shot at two of those seats he added that while itll be fair its no certainty could republicans get all four seats seliger said he hasnt been able to draw a legal map that would do that three yes four no  asked if his own seat is safe solomons feigned uncertainty i hope  for this weeks informal and unscientific poll of insiders we followed up on president obamas announcement that he will seek reelection in 2012 it was no surprise but now its official we asked whether obamas numbers will be better than the 437 percent he received in texas in 2008 and more than half think hell do worse about 30 percent think hell do about the same and only 18 percent think hell do better now than then democrats got a boost in texas in 2008 even with obama losing the election and 41 percent of the insiders think theyll do even better in 2012 almost a third think theyll do worse and 23 percent say itll be about the same and what of the republicans the beneficiaries of a huge election success in 2010 two thirds of the insiders think 2012 will be a worse year for the gop 10 percent think itll be better and 20 percent expect things will be about the same we asked for comments too and the full set is in our files section heres a sampling of those       do you think barack obama will do better or worse in the 2012 texas election than in 2008 when he got 437 percent of the vote  this is not clinton 96 clinton knew how to tack to the center obama is more of an ideologue his percentage will go down as long as the republican nominee isnt a cadaver   the african american and hispanic voters are less motivated   broken campaign promises gitmo afghanistan etc high energy costs stubbornly high unemployment will be tough to overcome even for a gifted orator   the one portion of the american electorate i expect obama to do better with in 2012 is hispanics fallout from the clinton primary and perhaps some racially based fearmistrust had him underperform with texas hispanics mostly due to depressed turnout the immigration backlash against republicans and more comfort with obama among hispanics should make for better performance particularly as they rapidly increase in population and anglos decline obamas prospects for improved performance would increase further if as is now being discussed his campaign makes a real effort to play here spending money to increase registration and turnout would help he should be able to get at least 45 in texas and possibly as high as 47 depending on the gop nominee   my sense is the sentiment of the texas voter will be that this maybe the worst presidential hangover ever  the emperor has no clothes   i think the governor and legislature are about to turn a lot of independents into democrats by decimating the schools health system highways and infrastructure of the state the voters last time said to economize the state  not destroy it obama wont carry texas but i think his percentage will be higher this time than last   the enthusiasm bo generated in texas and elsewhere is long gone   depends considerably on who the republican candidate is but for now ill assume the gop selects a reasonable candidate someone like daniels pawlenty or christie and not like romney gingrich or palin and therefore that obama will do worse  downballot texas democrats did relatively well in 2008 in spite of obamas loss how do you think theyll do in 2012  worse than 2008 but not marginally worse will do better than 2010   except for maybe dallas where blue is the new green  weariness with lack of gop leadership is spreading   republican gains in 2010 reflected the lower turnout of a midterm election with obama back on the ballot in 2012 democratic turnout should improve   while the number of republicans in the texas house will drop it will be the result of the redistricting process not the effect of obama or the texas democratic party in 2012   the open united states senate seat the redistricting process  texas gaining the 4 new congressional seats and the current antiimmigrant legislation budget cuts that harm latinos and working families will help the democratic in texas during the 2012 general elections   obama continues to be highly popular with african americans but that is not entirely the case with hispanics who are disappointed in the administrations decision to put off strong immigration legislation in before the 2010 elections moreover the zeal that existed in 2008 among younger voters generally is not the same at present surely the campaign will work to restore that excitement but that is very hard to achieve after four years  texas republicans had a great election year in 2010 how will they do with a democratic president seeking reelection on the 2012 ballot  no difference statewide but they will lose a dozen or so legislative seats and not just because of redistricting  obama will be toxic in texas everywhere but in south texas and in the inner cities   worse not because of obamanose but because post redistricting will not support the current number of house republicans   after the 2010 election there is nowhere for them to go but down the number of legislative seats they currently hold is simply not sustainable especially since reapportionment means fewer seats in heavily republican rural texas further presidential elections produce much higher voting among minorities which means democrats do better than in gubernatorial years   2010 republicans way outperformed themselves in 2010 they will come a little back to earth in 2012   the president is a drag on democrats in texas but democrats will do better in 2012 than in 2010 2010 was a high water mark for republicans   worse they wont do near as well in harris co as they did in 2010 not that dems will do as well as they did in 2008 necessarily theyll still lose dallas and travis tarrant willshouldcould stay purple theres a chance for dems to make gains in fort bend and williamson and republicans will allbutcertainly see their house majority drop around the neighborhood of 12 seats  san antonio republican senator jeff wentworths bill to allow concealed handguns on college and university campuses glitched this week but is expected to return to the senate floor early next week more than half of the house members have signed on to similar legislation and 13 senators in addition to wentworth have signed on to his bill which he says will make campuses safer by allowing students to protect themselves but the senates twothirds rule is an obstacle wentworth thought he had the numbers but it began to be apparent he might be derailed when one of the votes he was relying on to take up the bill senator eddie lucio dbrownsville said he had been under the impression that the bill wouldnt come up until monday lucio said wanted the weekend to mull an amendment by senator robert nichols rjackson that would exempt primary and secondary schools located on university campuses from the bill lucio wants an entire campus exempted if it contains such a school senator mario gallegos dhouston also backed off his previously pledged support for suspending the rules but wentworth didnt just face opposition from democrats senator steve ogden rbryan said that he did not believe the argument that the bill would make campuses any safer because it affected so few  only those who are 21 years old or older and have acquired a concealed handgun license he also said he would not back the proposed bill because of its inconsistencies though wentworth made clear that it was not his own preference his bill would allow private but not public institutions to opt out of the provisions wentworth said he would not accept an amendment that would allow public institutions to do the same senator robert duncan rlubbock who voted against similar legislation last session and said he wants to keep dorms gunfree filed an amendment to do that though it never came up for a vote after much discussion and gathering of players around the dais wentworth pulled the bill down and said he would try again on monday he said he is hopeful and optimistic that his bill will have enough votes at that time meanwhile senator wendy davis dfort worth has filed an amendment that would allow boards of regents of to set the policies of the universities in their systems heading for the full house legislation that would further screen applicants for indigent care who are legal resident aliens house bill 655 by representative van taylor rplano would allow counties to consider the income of an aliens sponsor  a person who issued an affidavit of support for the immigrant when he or she applied for legal status  if the noncitizen ever applied for medicaid the sponsors spouses income could also be considered taylor said collin county officials approached him and said they were spending money on several medicaid patients who had the financial means for other health care via their sponsors on federal applications for residency he added the sponsor must already attest he or she will not allow the applicant to be a burden to the state representative veronica gonzales dmcallen asked taylor why he felt the bill was necessary if the federal residency application already requires the sponsor to attest to the information she also questioned whether taylor was accusing the aliens in question of being coached into receiving indigent care when they shouldnt taylor said he is only trying to make sure indigent care goes to the indigent and says the bill is permissive nothing in the bill requires action he said as the house considers the fate of the railroad commission industry officials spoke out against the senate version that would change the agencys name to the texas oil  gas commission to be led by one elected commissioner instead of the current three concerns about regulatory authority were raised at the senate hearing along with questions about how the new agency would be funded for the second time this year the us supreme court issued a stay of execution for cleve foster based on his claim of ineffective counsel he can now petition for a rehearing on the contention that his original representation failed to challenge crucial evidence used in his conviction the stay also gives his lawyers time to work on their challenge to the new drug protocol to be used in texas executions one of the drugs texas used in its execution cocktail was replaced when the only domestic manufacturer of the drug stopped selling it in march the texas department of criminal justice announced the adoption of pentobarbital as a replacement but fosters attorneys charge that the process of picking the new drug was illegal because it was not open to the public so far their appeal has gone nowhere but they are also taking it to the state supreme court the house overwhelmingly passed a bill allowing aerial hunting of certain wild animals including feral hogs and coyotes supporters cited the amount of damage caused annually by feral hogs and how prolific they have become in urban areas that goes now to the senate state lawmakers would be allowed to carry concealed weapons everywhere they go under legislation proposed by representative tim kleinschmidt rlexington the attack on us representative gabrielle giffords of arizona has made some legislators nervous about appearing in public places without their guns kleinschmidts bill would allow them to pack heat in bars churches schools and sporting events citizens who meet all the requirements to carry a concealed weapon are banned from carrying one in those places no one knows yet what this years redrawn political maps will look like but there are already two lawsuits in the works over the data that will be used to draw them the mexican american legislative caucus filed suit in hidalgo county over what it called flawed census data collected during the 2010 census that may have resulted in undercounting of latino populations on the other end of the spectrum austin attorney mike hull whos being paid for redistricting work by the associated republicans of texas has filed suit trying to prevent the inclusion of noncitizens in totals used to draw new districts and claiming that counting such noncitizens dilutes the power of legal votes while the house was busy considering and reconsidering budget cuts the senate took up the issue of the longterm budget crisis because of changes made in 2006 the state has collected far less in taxes than it needs to fund current programs as legislators cut property taxes they revised the primary business tax to compensate but collections of the business tax continuously fall short of expectations senate finance committee chairman steve ogden rbryan suggested that lawmakers need to work on the fundamental flaws in the system or the next biennium is going to look even uglier texas has historically not allowed postconviction dna testing for inmates but that could change the senate has passed legislation loosening the requirements for testing and allowing the results to be used in court to exonerate a prisoner theres also a provision in the bill to compare the tested evidence to a federal dna database to identify the true guilty party a crowd of about 5000 texans from across the state gathered at the capitol to protest the deep budget cuts proposed in the house budget they called on lawmakers to close the budget gap by using money from the rainy day fund closing tax loopholes and working to find longterm solutions in revenue collection a crowd at a dueling rally supporting conservative budget balancing called on the senate to make even deeper cuts than the current house proposal governor rick perry reappointed three members to the texas board of physical therapy examiners robert gary gray of midland is a physical therapist and ceo

Politics, Not Just Numbers, in Budget Amendments	2011-03-31	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2011/03/31/politics-not-just-numbers-in-budget-amendments/	en	the house will launch friday morning into a 1645 billion budget proposal for 201213 which is about 23 billion or 123 percent smaller than the current budget general revenue funding  which comes mostly from state taxes and fees  would fall 46 billion or 52 percent from current spending the states debt service  what it pays on its borrowing in the budget  would rise 185 percent to 33 billion in the proposed budget but numbers arent all thats buried in the details of the budget lawmakers have filed hundreds of amendments that are largely political objectives from repealing instate tuition and financial aid for illegal immigrants to trying to push planned parenthood out of the family planning business heres a look at the numbers  and the politics  behind what lawmakers are slated to debate health and human services the house budget underfunds health and human service programs by 48 billion according to the legislative budget board  cutting provider rates by an average of 10 percent that section of the budget even with the

spending is almost as big as health and human services with 348 billion in all funds spending which includes 285 billion in general revenue thats actually more state spending than exists in the current budget but it leaves schools 78 billion short of what they should get under the school finance formulas in state law the biggest factors in that gap are increased enrollments of about 80000 students per year declining property values that affect local school funding and the use of federal stimulus money in the current budget which isnt available for the next spending blueprint to make the numbers work lawmakers would have to change school funding formulas to cut state and local entitlements by about 11 percent higher education would see cuts of 10 percent in general academic funds and in the formula funding for healthrelated institutions the overall budget for higher ed would be 211 billion including 136 billion in general revenue special items funding for specific programs at various colleges and universities would drop by 2539 million student aid would be cut 3577 million and the state would put 254 million less money into group insurance for higher education employees

temporary moratorium on student assessment during the two school years of the biennium  a plan thats popular with many teachers and administrators who want relief from testing as they cope with budget cuts public safety  the budget proposal puts 47 billion into adult prisons  almost all of that is general revenue  and the lbb writeup includes this line the projected number of incarcerated offenders are not fully funded for fiscal years 201213 and tdcj is expected to exceed capacity by at least 4700 beds by the end of fiscal year 2013  among the criminal justice amendments    representative erwin

worst days of hank skinners life  before it became what was probably one of the best days about an hour before the death row inmate was scheduled to be executed the us supreme court granted him a stay of execution skinner who was convicted of murdering his girlfriend and her two mentally disabled adult sons in 1995 has spent much of his time on death row arguing that dna evidence would prove his innocence in the crimes while some evidence was tested and put skinner at the scene key pieces that would indicate guilt  a rape kit and fingernail clippings  never were efforts to do such testing have been rejected even after an arizona firm offered to do such testing for free skinner believes the victims uncle who died in a 1997 car crash was the actual killer the tribunes brandi grissom reports the supreme court court issued an indefinite stay but it did not agree to accept skinners case the court said it needed more time to review skinners claims and to decide whether to intervene this action suggests that the court believes there are important issues that require closer examination said rob owen skinners attorney and codirector of the university of texas school of lawscapital punishment clinic we remain hopeful that the court will agree to hear mr skinners case and ultimately allow him the chance to prove his innocence through dna testing  skinners case first took on national prominence in 2000 when a group of students from david protess medill innocence project at northwestern university came to texas to investigate skinners claims the students work had led to the exoneration of 11 illinois inmates including five who were on death row between 1996 and 2000 in texas they interviewed andrea reed the states star witness who had recanted her trial testimony that skinner admitted to killing busby she told them she felt pressured by prosecutors to implicate skinner so she lied at trial the students also talked to donnells widow who said he became violent when he drank others in the community told them donnell often wore a windbreaker similar to one found at the crime scene neighbors reported seeing donnell within a week of the murders cleaning his truck with a hose and stripping the carpet and the students discovered several pieces of dna evidence that were never tested according to officials skinner found out about the stay as he was eating a cheeseburger part of large last meal that included a salad with ranch dressing and bacon bits popeyes chicken fried catfish onion rings and a chocolate milkshake culled  oops in appears that when brian birdwell discovered he didnt meet the residency requirements to run for the state house he took an unusual next step  starting a run for the state senate which has more stringent requirements to become a state senator one must live in the state for at least five years but a post on birdwells own site  dated february 22 2008 says ltc ret brian and mel birdwell moved to granbury tx in june 2007 and he voted in virginia elections in 2006 thats not stopping the wouldbe senator however his campaign spokeswoman told the tribune that hed soon be filing his papers for the special election to replace senator kip averitt  former state representative borris miles is back  with eight votes to spare at least thats what the official recount says his longtime opponent current state representative al edwards beat miles two years ago after miles won the seat from edwards in 2006 now after an official recount at edwards request it looks like the two will continue their game of musical chairs when miles takes back the office  revving up the state house and senate will be busy today despite being out of session in the house the ways and means committee will meet to discuss sales tax exclusions and tax structures while business and industry will look for ways to increase manufacturing jobs in the state and judiciary and civil jurisprudence will examine among other things

That Didn't Take Long	2010-03-22	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2010/03/22/that-didnt-take-long/	en	the first political ads bought by a corporation in texas appeared in east texas newspapers just weeks after the us supreme court effectively ended the states ban on that kind of spending the ads appear to mark the first instance of a corporation directly playing in a texas election since the nations highest court lifted a centuryold ban on political spending by corporations and labor unions that january ruling in citizens united v federal election commission doesnt affect contributions to candidates which remain restricted but does mean corporations and unions can spend money as they wish on politics and run all the ads they want  so long as they dont coordinate their efforts and messages and plans with the campaigns theyre promoting or with other thirdparty groups that have similar political interests the ads in the jacksonville daily progress the tyler morning telegram and the panola watchman took issue with the republican bona fides of representative chuck hopson of jacksonville a democratic incumbent who jumped to the gop in november and ran in a threeway race in the republican primary this month he got 61 percent of the vote easily besting michael banks and allan cain the newspaper ads ran on the sunday before the election a week earlier in panola urging voters to vote for anyone but hopson they were paid for by kdr development inc a real estate company whose president republican larry durrett lost to hopson in 2006 when hopson was a democrat durrett is also the president of southern multifoods a jacksonvillebased company with dozens of franchised taco bell kfc pizza hut aw and long john silvers restaurants the two companies are closely related sharing addresses officers and directors i think were on solid legal ground durrett said in an interview we checked it out every way from sunday  he wanted to run ads against hopson and had been reading and hearing about the supreme court ruling on corporate politicking durrett said he checked with a lawyer in tyler who sent him to a specialist in austin did a significant amount of discussion about this and then went to the papers with the ads my businesses do better under conservative people and not under people who arent durrett said there are an awful lot of folks on the republican side of the house who arent all that conservative and thats an irritant  he felt the other two candidates were more conservative than hopson and went from there he used corporate money for a simple reason you take the money out of the pocket thats got some money in there he said durrett doesnt consider hopsons win a complete loss for his side if you continue to point out that people arent as conservative as you are it moves them to the right  the ad has a quote on one side and the copy on the other is standard fare for a house race written in the form of a letter the quote from the austin americanstatesman house democratic caucus leader jim dunnam said hopson informed him of the move friday morning he told me he didnt have any intention of changing his voting patterns but he just thought it was an easier way of getting elected dunnam said  and the letter dear east texas republicans  for several years chuck hopson has represented east texas house district 11 as a democrat as he ran for office as a democrat throughout these election cycles he continued to support the democratic platform and agenda he even traveled to ardmore ok to fight a redistricting plan and promote the democratic agenda in east texas chuck hopson is now running in the republican primary and will be facing allan cain and dr michael banks there are records that show that 90 of hopsons contributions have come from outside the district from special interest groups and democrats and not the voters of hd 11 we need to vote for someone inside our district that is a true conservative republican in this election vote for your choice but please vote for one of the two true conservative republicans in this crucial redistricting year sincerely  kdr development inc before the supreme court ruling that would have been an illegal ad in texas purely based on the corporate funding so long as kdr didnt work with the campaigns or with anyone else on the copy it now appears to be the sort of direct corporate expenditure the supremes are protecting it raised some issues with us and i asked some people in the organization to look at it says amy miller publisher of the daily progress in the end they decided to accept the ad its a prepaid political ad and i didnt see anything wrong with it  the ad does bear some similarities to printed mailers sent by others cain for instance used that same quote from dunnam in a mailer that also carried the hopson is not conservative theme former state senator drew nixon rcarthage paid for ads in the race too using that dunnam quote again and using a chart very similar to the one used in cains flyer signed by three of the four gop county chairs in the district it was more direct in its hit on the partyswitcher make no mistake chuck hopson is a democrat  but as long as the corporation wasnt in league with anyone else they appear to be the first example of what might be possible under the courts ruling the texas ethics commission which regulates these things is still working on a full opinion of this new world of campaign finance the agency posted its first impression online right after the court issued its ruling  we believe the texas legislature intended laws under our jurisdiction to prohibit political expenditures by corporations to the full extent allowed by the constitution as interpreted by the united states supreme court in light of the recently issued united states supreme court ruling in citizens united v federal election commission it is our position that corporations are allowed to make all types of direct campaign expenditures  it is also our position that corporations are still prohibited from making political contributions unless specifically allowed  tec now has a draft opinion in circulation  not yet voted out by its board  that goes further for the reasons stated in citizens united we cannot  prohibit a corporation or labor organization from making a direct campaign expenditure or  prohibit an individual or other association from making a direct campaign expenditure  they can still block corporations and labor organizations from making contributions to candidates but they cant do anything if those outfits want to spend money for or against the candidates without the candidates knowledge the short version kip averitt quit david sibley and brian birdwell and darren yancy are running and the special election for the rest of the term is in may no democrats have been spotted in the vicinity of this tirekicking extravaganza the long version starts the same way senator averitt rwaco resigned from office a week after winning the gop primary for reelection to a seat he no longer wants to hold averitt announced in january  after it was too late to get off the ballot  that he didnt want to serve another term yancy of burleson was the only other major party candidate who signed up to run and although averitt didnt campaign he won handily he resigned his current term as of st patricks day what he didnt do is important averitt hasnt yet taken his name off of the 2010 ballot so the election for the rest of his current term can proceed while hes still the gops nominated candidate for the november election if and when he withdraws from the ballot the gop chairmen from the ten counties in sd22 will pick a replacement if that comes after the special election to replace averitt in may theyd be hardpressed to name anyone other than the candidate chosen by the voters but the law allows them to do as they please and in any case four of the chairmen are new and wont be eligible to settle this until after the first week of may anyway and then governor rick perry declared there would be elections in waco and in dallas on may 8 to replace legislators who quit early representative terri hodge ddallas resigned after pleading guilty to federal charges of lying on her tax returns averitt you know about the winners of the elections to replace them will serve until january when their terms end democrat eric johnson won the democratic primary for hodges seat and will take office in january whether he runs in may or not nobody else was on the ballot in averitts race sibley whos been a lobbyist since leaving office in 2002 announced he wants his old job back the senatorturnedlobbyist has been hinting for a couple of weeks and now says hell be a candidate for his former yancy wants another crack at it and was bragging earlier on that he had the support of more than half of those ten chairmen wholl be picking the party nominee and now birdwell a veteran injured in the 911 attacks on the pentagon says hell be in the race he lives in granbury and mulled a race against representative jim keffer reastland a while back birdwell hadnt lived in texas long enough at the time to be eligible hes from here but had been living in the washington dc area now he has and hell be in the special election candidates in either of the two specials have to file for office by the close of business on april 7 dogpile former state legislator rick green got everyones robe in a wad by getting into a runoff for texas supreme court against debra lehrmann of fort worth shes a judge hes never been one and while green is a lawyer hes never practiced courtroom law so five tsc justices endorsed lehrmann tom phillips craig enoch deborah hankinson barbara culver lack and alberto gonzalez former justice scott brister is sticking with green  the gop primary runoff in the race to replace representative joe crabb ratascocita has divided the two houses of the texas legislature senator tommy williams rthe woodlands endorsed humble school board president dan huberty meanwhile hubertys opponent anesthesiologist dr susan curling claims crabbs endorsement theyre both my constituents and i dont typically get involved said williams but i feel very strongly that dan hubertys the right guy to represent that house district i think because he served as president of the school board over there he brings a unique perspective to the legislature thats going to be very helpful  huberty led in the fourway primary race in a press release from the runnerups campaign crabb is quoted saying the greatest demand on a legislator is the ability to say no dr susan curling can say no i am voting for texan dr susan curling  also supporting curling is former representative peggy hamric rhouston dr susan curling will have the backbone and integrity to make the tough decisions on behalf of the citizens of hd127   after borris miles squeaked through the march democratic primary with only a 10vote lead in hd146 incumbent al edwards filed for a recount miles original 11vote lead dropped by one after harris county officials counted absentee ballots edwards asked for a recount because in a highly contested race  i strongly feel that its important that we take all necessary steps to ensure that no errors have been made  a candidate can request a recount if the difference between the winner and the secondhighestvotegetter is less than 10 percent of the winning candidates votes or if the total votes received by every candidate amounts to less that 1000  in hd47 former candidate david sewell endorsed paul workman in his runoff with holly white turner sewell cited workmans history in the district as well as his rocksolid conservative values as the reason for his endorsement  reeve hamilton and morgan smith the primaries may be pretty much over but the libertarian party has only just begun  and theyre hoping this will be a big year for the perennially losing party last saturday at the partys county conventions members chose their candidates for nonjudicial county offices and according to state party chair pat dixon these downballot races are the ones libertarians are most likely to win this saturday districts will make their picks currently only nine libertarians hold political office but momentum may be on their side according to their own website the libertarians successfully fielded 193 candidates including someone for every statewide office  something democrats failed to do dixon says the partys operating budget leapt from 120000 last year to 320000 this year thanks to big increases in fundraising the major parties arent too worried for themselves each saying the libertarians hurt the enemy on the democratic side party spokesperson kirsten gray said she expected any increase in libertarian votes would come at the expense of the republicans the libertarians do seem to be more closely in line with the tea party messaging she explained the republicans took a similar approach i think the democrats ought to be concerned said state gop spokesman brian preston not too concerned though the major parties are where viability is for a candidate he continued i think people have wised up to that   abby rapoport the shoe was on the other foot this week as state senator tommy williams rthe woodlands flew to washington dc to lobby against pres barack obamas health care reform legislation i had the tables turned on me a little bit said williams for the most part people were very nice i guess i got a little bit of a feel to know what its like for a lobbyist to stand outside  the texas health and human services commission forecast that obamas proposed changes would cost the state 24 billion over the tenyear implementation of the plan williams who worked on the health and human services budget last session says he was shocked by the number i felt it was incumbent on me to explain to the members of the texas delegation that we just cant afford that based on the budget shortfall that weve got coming he said in the less than 24 hours he was there he spoke with us representatives henry cuellar kevin brady gene green chet edwards ted poe michael mccaul lloyd doggett  who didnt agree to meet with williams but was tracked down in a hallway  among others williams made sure the report reached the entire delegation even those he did not meet my priority was to visit with democratic members especially those who had served in the legislature before williams said because those folks know what its like to balance a budget and i just felt it was important for them to hear   reeve hamilton 1 three people with ties to the us consulates office including two us citizens were killed across from el paso in ciudad jurez lesley enriquez 35 and her husband arthur redelfs 34 were shot dead on saturday as they left a daytime party enriquez worked at the consulates office jorge alberto salcido

House Democrats Target Alternatives to Abortion Program	2015-03-30	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2015/03/30/house-democrats-target-abortion-program-budget/	en	as the texas house prepares for a floor fight tuesday over its budget a flurry of amendments filed by democrats seeks to defund the states alternatives to abortion program a group of democratic lawmakers filed more than a dozen amendments to either reduce or eliminate funding for the program which provides pregnancy and parenting information to lowincome women under the program the state contracts with the texas pregnancy care network a nonprofit charity organization with a network of crisis pregnancy resource centers that provide counseling and adoption assistance since september 2006 the program has served roughly 110000 clients the network features 60 provider locations including crisis pregnancy centers maternity homes and adoption agencies state representative jessica farrar dhouston said she filed an amendment to defund the entire program because the state is giving more money to coerce women into a political ideology instead of providing information and services at a time when texas womens access to health services is being reduced the proposed house budget allocates 915 million a year to the program in 2016 and 2017  up from 515 million in the last budget i think its troublesome that here we are going to almost double funding for a program that has not proven to be successful in any way said farrar chairwoman of the womens health caucus in the house an additional amendment by farrar would require an audit of the program several house democrats filed similar amendments including borris miles of houston celia israel of austin and chris turner of grand prairie whose amendments would transfer more than 8 million from the alternatives to abortion program to family planning services and programs for people with disabilities these facilities have very little regulation no accountability and no requirement to offer actual medical services turner said adding that funding could be used for other medical programs my amendments are an attempt to address our states real priorities and needs  two republicans meanwhile filed measures to boost the programs funding state representative bryan hughes rmineola authored an amendment that would supplement the alternatives to abortion program with 335 million per year funded by a cut to the texas commission on environmental quality in a budget subcommittee hughes sought to increase the programs funding by nearly 15 million in the twoyear budget but that measure failed a separate amendment from state representative dade phelan rbeaumont would boost the programs funding by 335 million per year by cutting funding from a film and music marketing program in the governors office  a move he hopes will help the alternatives to abortion program extend into east and south texas theyve done a good job with what weve given over the last 10 years phelan said i think whatever increase we can give them is wellwarranted  state representative greg bonnen rfriendswood filed an amendment that would rename the program to pregnancy and parenting services which he said would defuse any controversy surrounding the program there are individuals who seem to dislike the program which i think is disappointing because the program really isnt about abortion rights or abortion restrictions said bonnen a neurosurgeon i find it a little disheartening and disappointing that anyone would want to take resources away from pregnant women or newborn children  this story was produced in partnership with kaiser health news an editorially independent program of the henry j kaiser family foundation a nonprofit nonpartisan health policy research and communication organization not affiliated with kaiser permanente our daily news summary

Guest Column: Use the Rainy Day Fund for Education	2013-04-16	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2013/04/16/guest-column-use-rainy-day-fund-education/	en	when i meet people in my district one of the first questions ill ask someone is where they went to school they dont answer texas u of h or tsu though they might have gone there they proudly answer me with their high school  jack yates worthing jones westbury  or for some of my older constituents wheatley in other parts of the state texans take pride in telling people they went to schools like permian churchill dallas carter westlake or psj schools are the cornerstones of our neighborhoods and communities however school funding was cut to the bone in 2011 my fellow democrats and i represent almost 18 million texan students therefore we stand ready to battle the republican majority for the future of our public schools and the future of texas the opportunity exists now to start making things right by using the rainy day fund to restore funding for education no district  rich or poor  escaped the devastating effects of the loss of 54 billion for education texans saw how republicanmandated education cuts affected their childrens classrooms texas classrooms are left with 21000 fewer teachers and staff texas schools have three times as many overcrowded classrooms than before the budget cuts funding to expand prek from halfday to fullday programs was completely eliminated our public school students are not secondclass citizens despite an 88 billion budget surplus the republican leadership refuses to fully restore funds for education cuts made in 2011 according to the center for public policy priorities the 9435 spent per student in the house budget is still 761 less than the amount spent in 2008 by the end of 2015 the rdf is projected to have a balance of almost 12 billion just as in the past we must use a necessary amount of that to close the gap in public education when voters approved the rdf in 1988 it was sold as a source of revenue to maintain current and ongoing services during tough economic times in fact when the fund was first tapped in 1991 the entire balance was spent on public education then in 1993 the legislature drained the fund to pay for criminal justice initiatives governor rick perry and the legislature used the fund to plug budget holes in 2003 and 2005 to pay for ongoing expenses like the teacher retirement system state health and human services the governors office and the texas education agency spending from the rdf for education and human services was the right thing to do 10 years ago and its the right thing to do now over the past few sessions the governor and republican leaders tried to redefine how the fund can be used for such things as onetime expenses however that idea is actually a new interpretation at odds with the funds original purpose and past usage investment in the human infrastructure of our state is as critical as investment in the physical infrastructure the senate proposed spending 6 billion on water and transportation how can we invest in our roads and dams while not investing in the future of our children who will use them in the future as the economist ray perryman wrote it makes little sense to underfund key priorities such as education  continuing the republican policy of grossly underfunding our schools does irreparable harm to our state former state demographer steve murdock projected that by 2040 continuing to underfund education can lead to a 40 percent increase in poverty a 50 percent increase in people on welfare and a 54 percent increase to the prison population on top of a declining average household income we cannot afford to continue down this path my wife and i had a baby girl during the 2011 special session i would rather have been by her side during her first week of life however i was in austin fighting for public education because it is simply that important to her future and the future of all texas children the legislature needs to act now and use the rainy day fund to restore our public education system and provide a bright future for all of our children in our great state of texas democrat borris miles of houston represents house district 146
Bill That Cuts Early-Voting Period Likely to Be Pulled	2013-04-08	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2013/04/08/bill-would-slash-early-voting-likely-be-pulled/	en	a bill that would slash the number of days allowed for early voting is likely to be pulled after scathing testimony monday from opponents who said the bill was discriminatory and retrogressive house bill 2093 by state representative patricia harless rspring would limit the earlyvoting period in texas to seven days before general and primary elections current law mandates 12 days harless initially said the measure was necessary to help elections administrators hire workers and volunteers saying that a 12day earlyvoting period as a possible deterrent but after testimony at mondays house elections committee hearing where critics slammed its intent as little more than an effort to make casting a ballot harder for everyone harless said she would not ask the committee for a vote this bill wasnt about voter suppression it was not about limiting access to the polls she said i will be happy to pull the bill down i think its perfect for an interim study  nina perales the vice president of litigation for the mexican american legal defense and educational fund or maldef said the bill would move texas backward by limiting the number of voting days available and by creating longer lines on days when voting is permitted she added that increased wait times would drive potential voters away the bill lacks a rational basis in election administration and will reduce voter confidence in texas she testified the texas chapter of the naacp the league of womens voters the texas democratic party the tarrant county elections office the dallas county elections office disability rights texas and the texas aflcio also testified against the measure but br skipper wallace the chairman of the texas republican county chairmens association said the bill was a goodfaith effort to motivate texans to plan better there is no magic number for what the number of voting days should be he said i dont know that one week for early voting is a magic number taxpayers pay an extraordinary amount of money to wait to the last minute voters have to take some responsibility  also supporting the measure was erin anderson with true the vote a houstonbased conservative watchdog group that seeks among other things to crack down on voter fraud and increase participation at polling stations several citizens want to get involved in the process but two weeks discourages them to do so anderson said seniors who are some or the most reliable poll workers find the full 12 days  in a row to be too demanding  but state representative borris miles dhouston was critical of the effort lets get the elephant out of the room he told anderson adding that in 2008 the majority of hispanics and latinos voted for president obama lets get down to what this is really about its about suppression  others were amenable to changing the bill from its current form ed johnson with the harris county clerks office testified for the bill but he said hed like to see it amended to leave presidential elections unaffected all other elections he said require far too much work and money for such a dismal turnout if the bill passed texas would have been home to one of the most limited early voting periods in the country according to attorney michael li who runs the website texas redistricting maryland allows six days while georgia and louisiana allow for five days of early voting li wrote on monday voters in oklahoma are limited to three days li also wrote that in more than half of texas 15 largest counties early voting exceeds 40 percent of all ballots cast in her testimony perales said that early voting during the november 2008 election accounted for 62 percent of the ballots cast up from 39 percent in 2000 after the hearing harless said the opposition came as a complete shock had the opponents bothered to pick up a phone and call her office she would have not wasted the committees time she said texas tribune donors or members may be quoted or mentioned in our stories or may be the subject of them for a complete list of contributors click here our daily news summary
                          A road called Almeda         	2009-11-01	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://www.chron.com//life/article/A-road-called-Almeda-1747957.php	en	theres a new vibe on almeda road its there at the sweetly refurbished peggy park where visitors can swing or play hoops or simply sit on a park bench and soak up the sun its there at gzs coffee shop where students from three universities and houston community college drink lattes study and attend poetry readings on saturday nights the buzz is there at spanish village the venerable mexican restaurant known for killer margaritas at the reggae hut with its mountains of steaming jamaican food and at melodrama a hip and affordable clothing boutique all these businesses are just a spit away from downtown the texas medical center the museum district and midtown hermann park is down the street coming soon to the third ward neighborhood are two new light rail lines including one that will cross almeda at wheeler almeda is hardly perfect  there are still plenty of empty lots and ramshackle buildings  but it seems inconceivable that a street so close to so much money and power can do anything but boom thats what delights and also worries those who have watched over almeda and guided and protected its growth whos going to get stomped when the gold rush begins as part of farm to market road 521 almeda stretches almost 95 miles from near downtown through harris brazoria and matagorda counties the area thats had the facelift  from new sanitary and storm sewers to new sidewalks street lamps brickwork and trees  is the 112mile strip from alabama south to brays bayou zinetta burney 68 and one of the streets godmothers has lived and worked near that stretch of almeda her entire life she remembers when the area south of alabama was primarily white middleclass and at least partly jewish and she remembers when the sitin at the lunch counter at weingartens grocery in 1960 helped integrate the neighborhood she also remembers the building of us 288 and the ruinous effect it had on almeda parallel to the freeway just a few blocks west when the freeway cut us off from the rest of third ward almeda just died burney says it wasnt until the 90s that three or four africanamericans started investing in land and businesses there and the street started to come back  early investors included gerald womack who began dabbling in third ward real estate when he was only 16 and insurancecompany owner borris miles both are selfmade men and both love almeda but it is burney womack says who is the most influential person on the street she before me he says shes board chairman of our tirz no 7 explained most simply its an arm of the city that uses tax dollars to improve the area and shes a real people person she offers love and support to the least of us ive seen her take a homeless person to fiesta to buy a sack of groceries  another key player in the almeda facelift is state representative garnet coleman he also was born and raised in the neighborhood and he remembers as a boy playing on 288 while it was still under construction as a politician he and others promoted the governmental tools that helped bring the street back from the dead the goal all along he says has been to revitalize almeda without destroying viable businesses or forcing longtime residents out of their homes his voice starts to rise as he describes the redevelopment of the fourth ward the historical black neighborhood just west of downtown its too late for the fourth ward the residents got pushed to the suburbs and the businesses got wiped away says coleman dhouston but what happened there informs everything we do here  if he sounds defensive protective and even angry sometimes he is this is my home he says everybody is welcome who wants to help sustain and protect the community  those who dont share the sentiment he seems to suggest should stay away at almedas northern tip is shape community center and rossonian cleaners venture close to the cleaners front door and tekle berhane is there with greetings weve been here since 1920 berhane says and we have a lot of the same customers  he doesnt mean the regulars having been coming quite that long but he ticks off a client list that is a virtual whoswho in politics in the third ward he also offers a quick tour through the plateglass windows across the street is spillers garage the mechanic there hes the best  berhane points to luigis pizzeria up the street a block or two the best pizza he says really i enjoy the whole street its very lovely  at the community center a mellow deloyd parker mostly approves of the new developments and offers some suggestions hed like to see kwanzaa celebrations this holiday season that echo up and down the street hed like to see more walking more biking and more vendors selling food and arts and crafts he admires the refurbished peggy park an example of how to make even a small pocket of green space a joy to behold at gzs its closing time but womack drives by and pops out of his escalade on saturday nights he says the place is overflowing he looks across the street and sees the forward times an africanamerican newspaper that has been publishing since 1960 he looks north and sees downtown ablaze in lights he looks south and sees cyclists and women in colorful jogging gear sailing by what i love womack says is that everybody is different everybody is diverse i have to say i never thought id see this happen people seem not bothered about race  beyond spanish village where the medina family has fed and nurtured generations of hungry houstonians is the reggae hut its owned by marcus davis the same restaurateur who operates the popular breakfast klub on travis he invested in his second restaurant and almeda because he has history with both he says hes mulling over the possibilities for a third business on the street too almost next door are the internet cafe sip  surf mid city cleaners and zayds naturally natural hair studio they are owned respectively by daaiyah kehlin and shawna farooq a mother and her two grown children every day is like a family reunion the farooqs say walk past kcoh the radio station thats been at the same spot since the 1950s and stop in at alfredas the oldiegoldie soulfood restaurant get there early before 9 am to catch everybodys favorite cook big mama her real name is naomi haynes shes 81 and her specialties are baked chicken and smothered steak she also makes a long list of vegetables and desserts including german chocolate cake iced lemon cake bread pudding and sweetpotato pie haynes comes to work every morning at 2 am shes the only one in the kitchen at that time but she says the solitude doesnt bother her cooking is a jealous job she explains you dont want people around  melodrama the boutique that offers the rare shopping opportunity on almeda is close by as is the black heritage gallery there robbie lee keeps a close eye on her business and on the street since the recession began shes been a little worried i want to see more boutiques more retail more restaurants and fine dining she says now it seems every vacant space is turning into a club something to do with alcohol  she shakes her head shes been encouraging africanamerican artists at her gallery for the past 23 years i have a wonderful and diverse group of customers she says a lot of them are men they know what they want and what they dont want they dont want to go to the mall  continuing south past the art gallery is another popular dry cleaner evergreen then paradour an 81yearold church thats been transformed into an event venue some luxury apartments and at the southern tip of the strip the mosaic a shimmering highrise condominium complex though the project recently was taken over by the federal deposit insurance corp and a collection of investors the project is a work in progress like everything else on almeda theres reason to hope the wonderful thing about almeda is that so many houstonians feel they own a chunk of it and the sad fact not enough of them actually do says theola petteway executive director of the ostalmeda corridors redevelopment authority our goal is to make sure no one is pushed out were not going to kick people to the curb  she is talking about renters so is cary wintz a history professor at texas southern university when he describes what happened in the fourth ward when 95 percent of the properties were owned by people not in the neighborhood it was gone  wintz says he knows developers are circling almeda theyre planning hundreds of millions of dollars in investments he says and over time theyre going to change the neighborhood  in some peoples eyes wintz says those developers will improve it others will see their street their neighborhood going up in flames even now there are townhouses and condominiums in the neighborhood that cost as much as 750000 that doesnt even include the penthouses in the mosaic if you want me to predict whats going to happen 20 years down the road wintz says almeda is going to be filled with the middle class and uppermiddle class i hope it will be lined with restaurants and shops i expect it will be lined with housing communities change or they die what we havent learned how to do is keep lowincome people in highrent areas  wintz lives just a few blocks from almeda i dont want to see the area become all black or all white he says if were going to be 21stcentury people we need to be tolerant and we need to live together

candid photos of borris miles at a 2007 holiday party a tiny detail in it convinced a harris county jury on thursday to acquit the former state representative of two counts of deadly conduct jurors who deliberated for only 45 minutes said they already were suspicious of testimony in the trial which had accused miles of pointing a gun during two holiday parties that year the photo they said just reinforced their doubt the photograph blown up to 18 inches by 24 inches showed three leading members of the black business community gladhanding each other shaking hands and patting each other on the back miles has his back to the camera former texas southern university board of regents chairman willard jackson and prominent businessman david harris are smiling broadly moments later according to the allegations miles took out a small pistol grabbed harris hand and put the gun in his open palm during miles fourday trial his attorney rusty hardin had harris and jackson repeat their testimony that moments after the picture was snapped miles pulled a gun a derringer on them then in closing arguments hardin picked up the picture and pointed out a small detail miles is holding a wine glass

CHRONICLE	http://www.chron.com//news/houston-texas/article/Top-of-ticket-holds-down-ballot-answers-in-Houston-1755126.php	en	last november republican chuck rosenthal was harris county district attorney ike was a deceased president the stock market was steady and hillary rodham clinton was favored to win the democratic presidential nomination at mayor bill whites reelection celebration former county government chief robert eckels was asked whether harris county might turn majoritydemocrat in 2008 like dallas county had in 2006 the republican said it would depend on who the parties picked for president since then the political scene has been upended like a tricycle in hurricane ike but two days before the election eckels statement still rings true with local democratic and republican leaders and others awaiting the outcome the major factors shaping the election results they said start with barack obama and john mccain and include the battered economy the hurricane local population changes the rush to early voting stations and scandals of the kind that led rosenthal to quit at stake beyond the houston areas contribution to the presidential vote are some congressional seats partisan control of the texas house half the countys state courts the offices of county judge district attorney sheriff tax collector and more local democrats out of power since george w bush was elected governor in 1994 say this is their year republicans cheering on their numerous incumbents say not yet democratic chairman gerald birnberg said excitement about obama and hispanic voters identification with the democratic candidate for us senate hometown legislator rick noriega could push the total harris county voter turnout to 13 million above the recordhigh 108 million in 2004 bush carried harris county in the presidential contest then with 585000 presidential votes more than in 2000 thats a sweep he said republican counterpart jared woodfill sees an opposite picture the march primaries drew 407000 voters to the closely contested democratic race and 169000 voters to the less dramatic mccaindominated republican contest if the parties had voted at equal strength in the primaries in a county that has been dominated for decades by republican voters the chairman said it would still leave room for an additional 500000 voters participating in a turnout of 13 million we may draw more independents than we may draw someone who is considered a republican partisan he said the massive early vote appears to support the democratic argument using public voting records and their eyes political scientists officials and strategists in both parties say the dominating forces in the 12 days of early balloting were africanamerican voters stimulated by obamas candidacy and other voters with a democratic voting history even in areas like katy where all these people who are showing up are supposed to be in white republican precincts they are blacks and hispanics who voted in march in the obamaclinton match and who are coming back to vote in the general election university of houston political scientist richard murray said but many of those voters will vote for obama and stop some may be former clinton supporters for mccain others will vote democratic to the back of the ballot giving a lift to the entire ticket down to the obscure judicial races woodfill said private surveys show his partys candidates polling well among independent voters and that some democratic primary voters especially women who supported clinton will cross over for the general election but in contrast to democrats counting on the top of the ticket for their vote draw local republicans are banking heavily on local races to help keep the entire county in the gop column it is conceivable that maybe some of our judges might be so strong that they might poll better than the top of the ticket said republican campaign consultant mary jane smith whose clients include several judges woodfill pointed to county judge ed emmetts largely positive high profile after hurricane ike and a slate of judges campaigning on experience and effectiveness as particular advantages republican us representative john culberson is trying to stave off democrat michael skellys challenge in a mostly republican district that provides more than its share of the total county vote my job in district 7 is not only to make sure that i win with a big margin but by turning out my vote the conservatives in west houston will carry the day for other republicans countywide culberson said instead they said if voters get beyond the presidential election they will be guided first by the candidates party affiliation or just use the straightticket vote option birnberg said he senses no great political effect from the wall street dive murray did democrats generally benefit when the economy is the top issue versus the traditional republican strong suits of national security and social issues he said and this is the first election since 1932 where the most perilous economic issues face the nation  among voters the democratic chairman asserted theres a sense of institutional embarrassment theres a notion that we just dont want a harris county that is plagued week in and week out by scandals woodfill countered that voters will appreciate the fact that he and other leaders helped banish rosenthal showing principled stands while he alleged democratic leaders looked away when some of democratic state representative hubert vos apartment complexes were found to be substandard and state representative borris miles was charged with deadly conduct miles case is pending murray said the total picture gives democrats an advantage going into tuesday night republicans may have only a 5 percent chance of retaining their elected positions he said but its still a chance alanbernsteinchroncom
