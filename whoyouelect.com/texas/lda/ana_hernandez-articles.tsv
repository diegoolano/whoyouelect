                          Houston to challenge Census Bureau's count of 2.099 million         	2011-02-23	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://www.chron.com//news/houston-texas/article/Houston-to-challenge-Census-Bureau-s-count-of-1691249.php	en	the city of houston will ask the us census bureau to change its official count raising questions about whether some apartment complexes or neighborhoods were missed houstons population is 2099451 according to census data released last week thats more than 100000 fewer people than earlier estimates and slightly below the 21 million that triggers an expansion of the city council to 16 members we thought we were well over 21 million said mayor annise parker noting errors in how the census defined some city boundaries the council expansion is still on as city planners and independent researchers try to determine what went wrong i think were all very disappointed in the census bureaus ability to actually count the immigrant populations and other hardtocount populations said jerry wood a consultant hired to review the results the bureau had a great story about how they were going to do a better job this time but i think the evidence is pretty clear that it didnt work  census maps show that much of east houston  most of the area inside loop 610 east of interstate 45  lost population as did sections of southwest and northeast houston those areas are predominantly latino and africanamerican populations that historically are most likely to be missed by the census its troubling said james rodriguez who represents east houston on city council youre always concerned about an undercount  but many of the affected areas are filled with small aging houses and apartment complexes and the lack of new subdivisions may explain some of the decline older folks die younger folks move if they can said michael emerson codirector of the kinder institute for urban research at rice university state representative ana hernandez luna whose district stretches from just inside the east loop to beyond the beltway noted that no census tract in her district recorded more than 81 percent of people mailing in their forms that fell to 63 percent in some tracts census workers were dispatched to housing units that did not return the forms by mail but hernandez luna said some people especially immigrants here illegally may have been reluctant to participate despite assurances the information would not be shared with immigration and customs enforcement were all a bit skeptical when were giving so much detailed information about our household she said for those that are undocumented they want the least amount of contact they can have with the government  other people say they were never contacted robert presbruhi who lives in denver harbor said he did not receive a form by mail nor was he contacted by a census worker it aint no big deal but i havent ever heard from anyone he said nobody took the census over here  census workers are supposed to track down people who dont return the forms but emerson said human error is unavoidable you hire census workers and they are just people he said they sometimes look at a neighborhood and  just make up something rather than go somewhere they dont feel comfortable  wood said early blockbyblock comparisons already have turned up discrepancies including an apartment complex at beltway 8 and pearland park that appears to have been missed entirely census data showed no one living on the block although satellite photos from april 1  the day of the official count  reveal cars in the parking lot he said where are they  wood asked they may not have been counted  but he and others acknowledge no count is perfect state representative armando walle who represents northeast houston said the census bureau tried to encourage participation to their credit they reached out he said but the system is not perfect  challenges to the official count cant be filed until june 1 wood said the city will report apparent errors  apartment complexes located on blocks where no residents were reported for example  and possible mistakes in where boundaries are located the bureau probably wont object to correcting boundary errors he said chronicle reporter chris moran contributed to this report jeanniekeverchroncom
                          Lessons in learning: Warde students teach history at Jennings         	2013-01-06	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://www.chron.com//news/article/Lessons-in-learning-Warde-students-teach-history-4169859.php	en	jennings school students learned about the california gold rush oregon trail civil war and underground railroad last week but they didnt learn about those subjects from their teachers instead 17 students in fairfield warde high school teacher james dacostas us history class on friday made five to 10minute presentations on those topics to all three fourth and fifthgrade classes at the palm drive elementary school ryan mcneil an 11yearold fifthgrader said he most liked a board game made by warde juniors meghana damaraju 17 and morgan miller 16 in the game students moved pieces based on a roll of dice and whether they could correctly answer questions that damaraju asked about the california gold rush the game even included chocolate coins wrapped in goldcolored foil but students werent allowed to eat them i liked the game because you got to have some fun with it and she also taught us some interesting facts ryan said of damaraju rebecca weinstein a 10yearold fifthgrader said she also most liked the board game but also enjoyed the presentation by warde juniors justin gaudet and blaise kirby on what travelers on the oregon trail ate i liked the cooking one because i kind of like to cook too and im also reading a book on the oregon trail rebecca said it was cool to learn about what they ate and what they had to bring along with them  gaudet and kirby both 16 said they also learned a lot from researching the oregon trail for their presentation its pretty cool to learn how limited the stuff was but they could still live off it kirby said of the food that travelers on the oregon trail ate over their sixmonth journey the food included biscuits johnny cakes pancakes made with corn meal instead of flour corn meal mush and corn dodgers most of the stuff was really bland tasting kirby told students brendan miner a 16yearold warde junior told jennings students about his greatgreatgreat grandfather who fought for the north in the civil war at the battle of opequon and battle of cedar creek he said soldiers in the union army outnumbered soldiers in the confederate army in both battles and that the union armys goal in the battles was to secure washington dc in the battle of cedar creek the union army had 31000 soldiers vs 21000 for the confederate army miner said this was the final battle to secure washington dc and the union was able to keep it safe from the south he said miner said his greatgreatgreat grandfather thomas ryan survived both battles but died about five years later of illness before his presentation miner said he learned of his relatives service in the civil war from his great aunt and from wwwancestrycom a website that enables people to research their family trees it gave me all the information about who he was where he lived and the battles he partook in miner said adding that he was very impressed by his relatives service in the nations bloodiest war jennings students also learned about the underground railroad a series of safe houses that enabled slaves in the south to travel to freedom from ana hernandez a warde junior who built an elaborate model of a safe house and told students about its secret rooms doors and passages before her presentation hernandez said she likes arts and crafts and that dacosta suggested she build a model of a safe house for her project jennings students also learned about the california gold rush from warde junior dylan bender who wrote a childrens book about it rumors of gold in california had existed for years before the gold rush people came from all over america and even internationally for the gold from california bender told students gold initially could be picked up from the ground but miners later had to find gold from panning in streams and rivers the gold rush ended after gold became harder to find and silver was discovered in nevada bender said damaraju said goldseekers didnt have an easy life they stayed in tents on their trips to california and some caught typhoid fever from contaminated drinking water and scurvy from a lack of fruits and vegetables she said miller damarajus partner said she learned a lot about the gold rush and was glad students liked their board game i was glad they wanted to play and were excited about learning about it she said dacosta said students in his us history classes have made annual presentations in fairfield elementary schools for the past 16 years and that this years students could choose any topic as long as it had something to do with us history between 1840 and 1890 other topics covered friday included cowboys the hunt for president lincolns assassin and billy the kids boss dacosta said his students also make presentations to elementary school students in stratfield school and north stratfield school my students are always surprised by how intelligent the questions are and how probing the questions are from the elementary school students he said after the 45 minutes devoted to presentations ended they get challenged and get positive feedback for their academic work  mary ann rooney a fifthgrade teacher at jennings said her students get to see the level of detail that goes into a high school history class as opposed to what we cover on the surface in elementary school

                          Harris County will likely lose state House seat         	2011-02-26	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://www.chron.com//news/houston-texas/article/Harris-County-will-likely-lose-state-House-seat-1692603.php	en	last weeks census figures showed that harris county grew dramatically during the past decade but not fast enough to warrant adding a new state legislative district the county in fact likely will lose one as texas lawmakers turn their attention to the complex and contentious task of redrawing their own districts that loss will set in motion a game of musical chairs to determine who has a place among the 150 house seats that number does not change despite a 20 percent increase in population statewide which means the kaleidoscope of voters each lawmaker represents will shift harris county is expected to go from 25 to 24 state house seats legislative districts redrawn every 10 years in the wake of federal census results must be roughly the same size somewhere near 167637 people per district although harris county is home to more people than in 2000 its growth lags behind such suburban areas as fort bend and montgomery counties much of the redistricting process is a legalistic one involving adherence to federal law and state redistricting principles said trey trainor an austin lawyer who advises republicans on redistricting from a political standpoint trainor said it gets bloody when you start looking at population loss and you have members of the legislature who just dont have the sheer numbers in their district and youve got to go someplace else to get them you start cutting into core constituencies of other members  in harris county the question is who will be the odd man or woman out its not necessarily that the seat goes away trainor said but youre going to end up with one or two incumbents in the same district having to run against each other if they decide to do that of course you know a lot of times what happens in these cases is somebody whos been here awhile decides to retire and makes it easier on everybody else  the 17member committee is scheduled to meet for the first time next week as in the house state senators who represent the western part of the county have ample constituents to shed republican senator dan patrick for example whose district is more than 200000 people over what the average senate district will contain represents the most populous district in the state in the house democrat representative carol alvarados 145th district with 132730 people is down 208 percent as are districts represented by her innercity cohorts including state representative scott hochberg a democrat whose district 137 fell to a population of 137876 which is 178 percent below the mean district 143 an innercity district represented by ana hernandez a democrat has a population of only 127381 about 24 percent below the mean the 1965 voting rights act requiring that minority voting rights not be adversely affected by the redistricting process complicates the mapdrawing process almost every single district represented by hispanics is underpopulated that makes the voting rights act very very difficult to comply with because integration has worked in harris county said harris county judge ed emmett at what point does the justice department say you have such an integrated community it no longer applies  republicans control the process so theyll do whats advantageous to their members but the voting rights act wont allow any dilution said democratic consultant keir murray of houston legislative districts west of downtown gained population dramatically state representative william callegari a republican represents 264426 people in district 132 nearly 58 percent above the mean with a population of 212484 district 150 represented by debbie riddle a republican is 268 percent above the mean incumbents will have to start pushing and pulling in different directions  to use republican consultant allen blakemores phrase  to equal out the districts scott hochbergs gone blakemore said hes under and hes a white democrat  that sentiment could be premature said political scientist mark jones of rice university hochberg is gone if you change the district by too much he said hes wellknown in the area he represents but if he has to pick up population in an area where hes not all that wellknown he could be in trouble hell be fine if he keeps maybe 65 percent of his current district hes more endangered if you create a district thats more hispanic  hochberg said he has not given any thought to his districts makeup ive been busy with nonstop appropriations hearings he said ill worry about this when i get done with what im doing  jones suggested that sarah davis a rookie republican representing a central houston district could be in trouble davis district is 122 percent below the mean shes squeezed jones said because shes close to democratic districts plus her district is likely to swing back in 2012  while harris county may lose a legislative seat fort bend county is likely to gain one that follows a statewide trend dallas county for example is likely to lose two seats while its fastgrowing neighbors denton and collin counties will gain seats joeholleychroncom

                          History shadows race to finish Moreno's term         	2005-10-23	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://www.chron.com//news/politics/article/History-shadows-race-to-finish-Moreno-s-term-1491316.php	en	its never been easy to keep track of shifting alliances in houstons often fractious hispanic political community and thats especially true in the race for state house district 143 of the six candidates seeking the seat in a special election to complete the term of the late representative joe moreno three are supported by feuding factions or longtime politicians two have previously run against each other and the former incumbent its amazing to me how far back this goes were like on the third generation of this persons protge running against a third generation of this other persons protge said candidate rick molina 39 a lawyer weve had many many years of fighting and bickering among factions in this community it gets old lets try something else to move the district forward  this would be the time to do it when moreno was killed in a may 6 car crash his death left wideopen a district that sprawls alongside the houston ship channel east of downtown and is crisscrossed by factories refineries and railroad tracks houstons early hispanic settlers made their homes alongside those tracks solidly working class and predominantly democratic voters tend toward breadandbutter issues education health care insurance coverage services for children and assistance for the poor and elderly most of the candidates grew up in this district or seamlessly similar adjacent ones and say they will address these concerns all identify themselves as democrats and their political views are similar most can claim professional or political bona fides thats the nice part of the race the notsonice part is the behindthescenes maneuvering less by the candidates than by their feuding supporters ana hernandez 27 is a mexicanborn immigrant who graduated from the university of texas law school and is a lawyer with conocophillips hernandez worked in austin for moreno and for his close friend state representative jessica farrar farrars support for hernandez along with that of state senator mario gallegos and state representative rick noriega has brought her campaign a slew of endorsements and a pile of money from special interests this has spawned charges from opponents that she is the anointed candidate who if elected would be beholden to many hernandez disputes this i dont believe its being anointed i believe ive worked with these people on many projects in the past and ive earned their support said hernandez citing her years of experience in austin salinas is the niece of former state representative diana davila who is married to former state representative roman martinez he fought and lost an infamously bitter 1994 race against gallegos to become houstons first and only hispanic state senator that acrimony has continued but gallegos longtime political consultant marc campos is now working for salinas they dont like each other but thats their deal campos said i just honestly think laura will do a pretty good job in austin salinas who was raised and lives in the district and her supporters have accused hernandez and candidate al flores of moving into the district to run moreno who was opposed by flores in the 2002 democratic primary made similar accusations against flores and in 2000 against opponent dorothy olmos olmos a constructionfirm owner and mother of four also is a candidate i hate that because this became a vacancy and an open seat people decided this is an opportunity lets jump on it  said salinas who works for a commercial real estate company residency is a big issue its one thing to listen to the issues and to complain about them but its another thing to drive home to them at night and live them  salinas downplays hernandezs funding and endorsement advantage the main endorsements im seeking are the endorsements of the voters thats who this seat belongs to she said flores 47 is backed by former city councilman john castillo whom flores describes as a mentor since his university of houston college days when castillo helped him form the latin american student services association ive always run as a democrat flores said he blames the confusion on votes in republican primaries to help fellow latino attorneys win harris county judgeships which in recent years have all gone to republicans flores is a former president of the houston hispanic trial lawyers and the mexicanamerican bar association of houston but if i am able to work across the aisle in austin thats better for the district in terms of committee assignments and getting key legislation passed flores said if i cant manage to do that ill be basically inept  olmos whose father once was a community liaison for castillo dismisses most of her opponents as inexperienced or worse theyre green behind the ears theyre not seasoned the only reason why theyre in the race is barrio politics she said of hernandez and salinas who are making their first political runs but are viewed as frontrunners castillo gallegos and martinez are oldguard politicos who want someone in office they can manipulate ive been campaigning for this seat for nearly six years i have a track record of over 25 years of community service and im capable of doing the job  there are so many people that want to get involved in the political process but dont because they dont have any hope anymore and think youre just another crooked politician said molina who has been walking the district since june that can be changed people are tired of candidates being with this camp or the other i have always been independent i knew it was going to be hard but i want to see if i can make a difference in the community  george gives perhaps the most unusual reason for running after 10 years as a truck driver with a freight company in the district he said he was dismissed after a 2002 attack by four hooded gunmen caused a bout of posttraumatic shock george said that led to panic attacks fears of being attacked again and a request to carry a gun on the job that was denied by his employers he thinks he was treated unfairly by his employers and the police i want to work for the rights of workers and crime victims george said i also would introduce a bill creating a voluntary socialized medicine plan for the state for those who want to pay into it and be covered i also believe in legalizing casino and slot machines as a source of state income as opposed to raising property taxes or instituting a state income tax  lorirodriguezchroncom

Running Shoes	2005-12-12	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2005/12/12/running-shoes/	en	former house speaker pete laney dhale center surprised the political villagers by announcing he wont run again but most of the preelection news so far has come from people who are running for office after all for instance representative fred hill rrichardson says hell run for reelection next year instead of seeking a local office some of his fellow republicans in dallas have been encouraging him to run for dallas county judge but hes decided to stay put the incumbent in that county gig margaret keliher has been getting mixed reviews in her own party and some in the gop are nervous about steady democratic gains in election results there hill first elected to the house in 1992 is chairman of the local government ways  means committee had he decided to chase the county job he would have been the eighth chairman to opt out of reelection and beverly woolley rhouston filed for reelection after months of rumors  her staff was busily denying them  that she might give up show biz woolley chairs the calendars committee which sets the lower chambers agenda and is an important legislative gatekeeper another powerful house member vilma luna dcorpus christi says shes been telling anyone who called that shed seek reelection not enough people called maybe her name was at the top of the list when nueces county judge terry shamsie announced he wont seek reelection next year shed be a strong candidate but she has filed for reelection paid her fees and signaled gossips to talk to the hand shes the houses ranking democrat if youre using committee assignments as the measure  shes on appropriations calendars and ways  means candidates whose districts cross county lines file with their state party offices those whose districts stay inside the lines can file with county party officials to watch the state stuff link to the state parties at wwwtexasgoporg and wwwtxdemocratsorg independent candidates dont have to file with their political parties but do have to file papers with the texas secretary of state stating their intent to run and they have the same deadlines  filing between now and the close of business on january 2 thats why richard friedman  better known as kinky  made an appearance at the state capitol theres also that side benefit of tv cameras and people with pens and skinny notebooks who showed up to scribble about it friedman will apparently be the first texas gubernatorial candidate on television his campaign plans to uncork three spots next week and to have them up and running two weeks before christmas at our deadlines the content wasnt available but his aides have said theyll be pushing holiday sales of the kinky action figure loaded with 25 of the candidates comments and slogans its one of the few dolls we know of that comes with a toy cigar were not sure it amounts to anything at this point but pollsters working for an unidentified candidate have been asking respondents whether they would support comptroller carole keeton strayhorn in a bid for governor as a republican or as an independent candidate in the first case shed be up against governor rick perry in a primary with hardcore gop voters whove shown a decided lean to the incumbent in the second assuming she could quickly build an organization to get her the signatures to get on the ballot shed probably be in a fourway race with perry friedman and the winner of an increasingly populated democratic primary more candidates but also a completely different set of voters because of those deadlines cited above youll know by the first week of 2006 what shes up to her filings will tell the story texas democrats might be at ebb tide but theyll have candidates in at least four of the contests for statewide office and their gubernatorial primary might grow houston lawyer barbara ann radnofsky filed papers to run for the democratic nomination for us senate she hopes to knock off us senator kay bailey hutchison next year and plans to do it with issues you can look at the whole enchilada on her website at wwwradnofskycom click on ten proposals and positions wed have pointed out this next bit even if she hadnt pointed it out to us its got more footnotes than the organ at church the democratic primary for governor could have three people in it former legislator and judge bob gammage who now lives in llano appears closer to running for that office former us representative chris bell of houston planned to sign up during the first week of filing and educator felix alvarado of fort worth who lost threetoone in 2004 to us representative kay granger rfort worth has said hell run for the top state job alvarados sister maria luisa alvarado is running for lieutenant governor and david van os a san antonio lawyer and populist democrat whos been on the ballot for statewide judicial office in the past is running this time for attorney general he had some words for a group of political reporters we democrats all support each other we all love each other and weve all got big surprises for your cynical editors next november  three republicans have possible cakewalks ahead although talking about it too early is like breaking a mirror or chasing a black cat under a ladder susan combs todd staples and jerry patterson do not at the moment have democratic opponents for comptroller agriculture commissioner and land commissioner state district judge pat priest dismissed conspiracy charges against us representative tom delay and two political aides but they could still face trial on charges of money laundering all three men and illegal use of corporate money in campaigns delays associates a copy of priests order is available in our files section or by clicking here the judge struck conspiracy charges against colyandro and ellis but they still face charges of money laundering and making illegal political contributions he dismissed a conspiracy charge against all three men but left in place charges alleging money laundering against them priest said defendants questions about prosecutorial misconduct might require a hearing if the defense lawyers prevail there it could result dismissal of the remaining charges against the three men delays lawyers joined by lawyers for jim ellis and john colyandro two political aides to the sugar land republican have raised questions about how prosecutors worked with three separate grand juries in less than a week to produce the latest indictments also pending are defense motions to move the trial out of travis county they contend their chances of a fair trial have been poisoned by coverage of the investigation and by the antirepublican political leanings of the countys residents priest in an email to reporters said the prosecutors have until december 20 to appeal his ruling if they wish to do so in a written statement prosecutors said they havent decided on their next step lawyers for the defendants attacked the conspiracy charges early on saying prosecutors were accusing their clients of breaking laws that werent in effect at the time priest agreed with them and tossed those charges but while he said there couldnt be charges of conspiracy to illegally use corporate money in an election there were laws at the time restricting the use of corporate money in campaigns those charges he left in place and he laid out the charges much more plainly than the prosecutors have ever managed to do the election code by its express terms prohibits the giving or receiving of corporate funds for the purpose of financing a candidates election effort  he wrote a person may not knowingly make or accept a political contribution in violation of chapter 253 therefore a contribution intended by the corporation to be used for financing a candidate is unlawful likewise if one solicits corporate contributions with an unlawful intent to divert the funds to a candidate a violation by the diverter occurs when the funds are actually so diverted without regard to the intention of the corporate giver finally if corporate contributions are received for a lawful purpose but subsequently diverted to an unlawful purpose a violation of the election code occurs when the funds are so diverted and actually distributed to an individual candidate  priest cautioned hes not yet in a position to judge the facts in this case but is just laying out the substance of the charges prosecutors still have to prove any of that stuff happened delays lawyers contended that money moved around by texans for a republican majority pac was in the form of checks the laws refer to funds and they said there was a difference priest disagreed and laid out what the prosecutors have to do to prove moneylaundering charges if the state can prove that funds were obtained from corporate contributors by these defendants with the express intent of converting those funds to the use of individual candidates or if the state can prove that these defendants entered into an agreement to convert the monies already on hand though originally received for lawful purposes to that use by sending the money to the republican national state elections committee with an agreement that funds of the same amount would then be made available by that committee to individual candidates for texas political office and can prove that funds in the same amount were in fact contributed to individual candidates by the republican national state elections committee then they will have established that money was laundered the money would have become dirty money at the point that it began to be held with the prohibited intent of course if the state cannot establish that beyond a reasonable doubt then the defendants will be entitled to be acquitted  priest then went through an array of cases that spell out just what is and is not money laundering in one he flagged an argument thats been made in defense of what trmpac and the rnsec did in 2002 incidentally the court in one of the cases cited also held that the fact that dirty money is commingled with other nondirty money does not prohibit a finding of money laundering  one defense offered in this case is that transactions mentioned in the indictments were only a part of the business between the state and national political organizations in the indictments the men are accused of accepting 190000 in corporate contributions which they then sent to the rnsec which then contributed the same amount  in noncorporate money  to seven candidates for the texas house of representatives delays lawyers are asking the judge to hit the gas  they want quick resolutions to his legal troubles and want the judge to set hearings right away theyre also asking him to separate the indictments against delay a move that would allow priest to move immediately on moneylaundering charges against the texas congressman while he waits on the state for its reaction to rulings on other charges the judge has said hell wait a couple of weeks to give prosecutors time to decide whether they want to appeal his ruling dismissing part of their indictments against delay and two codefendants still pending are delays requests for a change of venue and his challenge that prosecutors illegally manipulated grand jury proceedings to indict him in a letter and a motion delay lawyer dick deguerin asked the judge to call a venue hearing for next week and to set a tentative trial date for early january that would allow things to keep moving on remaining charges even while priest waits to see what the prosecutors decide about the dismissed indictment in his letter deguerin nodded to politics saying delays legal predicament is messing with his clients day job as i have stressed before disposition of these charges as soon as possible is our urgent request congressman delay was required to temporarily step down from his leadership position in congress because of the return of the first indictment which charged a nonexistent crime the continued pendency of these charges adversely affects the business of the 22nd congressional district and the united states congress  us representative tom delays troubles are more political than legal at the moment others in congress covet his title and position and voters in his district say theyd prefer an unnamed democrat to the sugar land republican first he needs a relatively quick ending to his legal tangles in austin if hes to regain the leadership job he lost because of the indictments even if he wins dismissal of the charges or is acquitted he can lose the political game the folks keeping his seat warm will eventually want it for themselves if he takes too long to free himself of the prosecutors in travis county and his travails in texas and in washington are starting to erode his support at home a gallup poll done for usa today and cnn shows an unnamed democrat would beat him 4936 with registered voters in his district and 4734 with all residents registered and not there those sorts of results generally tighten up when the unnamed candidate gets a name in this case former us representative nick lampson who moved from beaumont to run against delay has the advantage of being relatively unknown if you read that to mean that voters dont have much to hold against him you can make the argument that their dislike for the incumbent could carry the day delays argument is more likely to be that voters wont like lampson when they know him better and theres almost a year left for that educational process when asked about the democrat 28 percent of registered voters had favorable impressions of him 11 percent had unfavorable impressions and 37 percent had never heard of him asked about delay 37 percent had favorable impressions 52 percent were unfavorable and 1 percent had never heard of him in both cases the balance of the voters registered no opinion delays lawyers have talked about trying to move his trial  if there is one  from travis to fort bend county they might want to do some research first gallup found that 55 percent of adults in his district think the charges against him are definitely or probably true 31 percent think the campaign finance charges are probably not or definitely not true they were split pretty evenly 4543 percent when asked whether prosecutors were fairly enforcing the law or trying to hurt delay politically the survey was based on phone interviews with 803 adults in the congressional district the margin of error was  4 percentage points former house speaker pete laney dhale center wont seek reelection next year laney first elected to the texas house in 1972 was elected speaker in 1993 and served for five terms he was knocked off in 2003 after republicans won a majority of seats in the house in the 2002 elections and raised representative tom craddick rmidland into the top office laney has been a thorn in craddicks side and a daily reminder to veteran legislators of the differences between the current administration and the old one which administration they preferred varies by member hes also served as the focal point for conspiracy theorists on the republican side who credit him for many of the tripups engineered by house democrats other democrats meanwhile have been stuck in laneys shadow because hes still in office and because the republicans presume he wants his old job back a lot of partisan activity by democrats has been dismissed as an effort to resurrect laney his departure also changes the game for moderates in the gop some of whom have grown accustomed to being labeled as laney supporters with him out of the house their quiet conversations about craddick successors can focus on new blood instead of revenge laney took over the house after one of its periodic forays into legal trouble and he was the first house speaker in years to serve more than a term or two without scandal he was elected with the class of texas politicos who rode the sharpstown scandal into office in 1972 an episode that brought down thenspeaker gus mutscher and others billy clayton was acquitted on charges of taking a bribe in 1980 he survived another term but gave way to gib lewis and lewis survived ethics misdemeanor fines early in his tenure only to have another round of ethics troubles sink him in the early 1990s laney followed him into office pushing ethics reforms and open access to what had become a very secretive legislative process and served five terms only he and lewis have lasted that long in the high chair before craddick upended him in 2003 laney changed the legislative process by rearranging the houses session calendar to wind business down in the last six weeks rather than let everything go to midnight on the last day that change forced the senate to change its approach and remade the legislative process and he was the last in a string of democrats at the top of state government who  because of circumstances or personalities  had to work with republicans to get their work done laney and thengovernor george w bush and thenlieutenant governor bob bullock had a famous working relationship partly because they actually got along and partly because none could get anything done without the help of the other two only two members  craddick and paul moreno del paso  have been in the house longer than laney and only one other member of the huge reform class of 73  representative senfronia thompson dhouston  is still in the house laneys hd85 might be the most republican landscape in the state still in the hands of a democratic incumbent laney who remains popular there got 59 percent of the vote in last years general election while every other nonlocal democrat on the ballot was getting creamed bush got 76 percent of the vote and the average democrat running statewide got just 41 percent of the vote there only one republican has filed for the seat  insurance agent jim landtroop of plainview  but with laney out more will join in his retirement announcement laney encouraged potential candidates to run adding the people of this district have an expectation of bipartisanship  staff lawyers at the us department of justice thought the congressional redistricting plan approved by texas lawmakers in 2003 was unconstitutional but were overruled by their bosses and keeping their memo under wraps until now the washington post broke the story probably saved republicans from defending themselves against the objections raised by those staff lawyers the us supreme court is still considering whether to hear the challenge to the plans which after being approved by doj were approved by a panel of three federal judges it might be too late but lawyers for the mexican american legal defense and education fund publicly asked the supremes to look at the memo before deciding whether to hold a full hearing in a long memo available in the files section on our website or by clicking here which was never seen by the three judges who decided the case staff attorneys in the agencys voting rights section said the texas plan dilutes minority voting strength those lawyers unanimously recommended that it be rejected their superiors overruled them and that position  that the maps were legal after all  has so far held up in court republicans dispute the minority claim noting that the number of blacks in the texas delegation increased from two to three democrats acknowledge that but say the number of districts where minorities have significant voting strength was cut voters in two of the old minority districts elected anglos to congress according to that argument those maps were also used in the 2004 election in which republicans overtook democrats in the texas delegation to congress for the first time since reconstruction the texas maps produced a gain of five republican seats in the delegation and swung the partisan balance of the texas crew in washington to the gop those five seats gained in texas were the only five seats the gop gained in congress in the 2004 elections houston voters pick a state representative this weekend settling the runoff contest between democrats ana hernandez and laura salinas in hd143 to replace the late joe moreno  the next special election on the plate will replace representative todd baxter

be eligible for the january election he is eligible for the regular election filing in that race is open through december 19  dan patrick the radio talker whos running for state senate in houston touts a poll that shows him ahead of the other candidates  mark ellis peggy hamric and joe nixon  in a fourway race hes at 38 percent according to his survey followed by hamric at 133 nixon at 85 percent and ellis at 78 percent the margin is  49 percent it also contends hes got higher favorable ratings than the others by far and that his unfavorables are lower than ellis while higher than the two state representatives the battle there is well underway nixon has launched his second round of television spots these focus on immigration policy mainly a federal concern but an issue that apparently polls well with gop primary voters in houston and elsewhere  san antonio city councilman richard perez told the expressnews he wont run for the hd118 seat opened by representative carlos urestis decision to challenge senator frank madla dsan antonio only one candidate  republican steve salyer  is in that house race at the moment salyer lost in 2004 to uresti by a 15point margin  a

republican party of texas hes not saying its a go but in an email to members of the state republican executive committee he raises a bunch of questions about the current condition of the rpt that email says the party has less money on hand than any of its bigstate counterparts and questions whether the texas gop has an active major donor program and no finance director or finance committee he also questions the partys decision to rush into an agreement with the travis county attorney to limit the rpt  get out the vote effort in 2006 when a more aggressive approach would have been

The Middle-Finger Primary	2005-12-05	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2005/12/05/the-middle-finger-primary/	en	kinky friedman has to have almost 50000 signatures to get on the ballot as an independent candidate for governor next year his campaign folks are aiming higher hoping to get two or four times that many  100000 to 200000 signatures  to show outsiders how serious they are and while state law seriously restricts anybodys ability to get on the ballot without a party affiliation organizers hope friedmans outsider cachet voter antipathy to the major party candidates and the cheap communitybuilding power of the internet will raise their chances friedman supporters arent allowed to sign up until after the march primaries the campaign has 60 days to collect those signatures each signature has to come from a registered voter and anyone who votes in any party primary or runoff next year is disqualified as a valid petitioner the people who collect the petitions have to swear that they witnessed the signings that they read a brief legal statement to the signers and that they minded all of the states other rules for petitiondriven campaigns the last independent candidate to win the texas governorship was sam houston nobody in recent memory has cleared the hurdles for the state ballot though ross perot got on the presidential ballot by presenting box loads of petitions in 1992 without the internet the campaign would have to rely on doorknocking and persontoperson contacts with the internet they can snag people who visit their website asking whether theyd like to volunteer or help or just sign up for more campaign information some of the people caught in that net then organize local groups regional groups and so on dean barkley the campaign manager and reid nelson the field director say theyve signed up enough people to build organizations in 50 to 60 texas counties they ask them to take a pledge i pledge that i will save myself for kinky and will vote in neither the republican nor the democratic primaries in 2006 instead i will save myself and when the day comes to sign the petition to put kinky friedman on the ballot as a candidate for texas governor i will do so proudly  and they ask them to download a collection kit that lets volunteers sign up friends and mail their names into the campaign theyre trying to recreate what a healthy political party already has in place  a network of people wholl do the grunt work of a campaign in this case theyre building a network that will produce all of those signatures either with volunteers and paid coordinators wholl handle the supervising and collecting of signatures or by assembling the lists of people wholl actually sign their names in effect theyre assembling the names and contact information about their voters before they have to go out and actually collect signatures nelson says they should know even before the primaries whether theyll be able to pull it off for the most part the network isnt a critical part of the campaigns fundraising the local groups can hold fundraisers but thats done out of austin for the most part and the organization is mainly set up to collect the needed signatures and generate enthusiasm the effort is invisible if youre not looking for it and there are some holes in the network  amarillo and laredo for instance have been slow to join up but they have the rest of the big counties and among those some real hot spots like central texas and the hill country this is familiar ground to anyone who has worked with volunteers whats different is that the volunteer group isnt already in place as it grows the idea is that the new organization will maintain itself contacting volunteers and signers sending preprimary reminders not to vote reminding them not to vote in the primaries when the primary elections are over theyll start signing the actual petitions through the regional and local and small group leaders theyve already contacted their deadline is in may at that point the election people at the texas secretary of state figure out whether friedman has enough legitimate signatures to get on the ballot representative carlos uresti dsan antonio will give up his house seat to challenge senator frank madla of san antonio in the march democratic primary uresti has been openly considering such a race for weeks he plans to concentrate on two of madlas votes  one in favor of a health and human services consolidation that downsized childrens health insurance and other programs and one in favor of a tax bill during this years school finance battles that uresti and many other democrats said was easy on the wealthy and hard on the poor uresti has been a legislator since 1997 madla took a seat in the house in 1973 and joined the senate in 1993 uresti has a big fundraiserparty every year at a vfw hall in his district and plans to make the formal announcement there he says hes hired democratic political consultant kelly fero of austin to run the race uresti did some polling before making up his mind and says he and the incumbent are within five percentage points in san antonio and that the numbers get better when voters are educated about things like those two votes hd19 could be a hot pocket in a relatively calm political year most statewide races are  at the moment  uncontested and most legislative and congressional seats in texas thanks to the twin obstacles of incumbency and redistricting arent competitive but with a senate race a house contest to replace uresti and a threeway race in cd28 voters might have a lot of people banging on their doors we dont have names yet for the uresti race  theyll surface when hes official in that other contest us representative henry cuellar dlaredo is being challenged by former us representative ciro rodriguez dsan antonio and state representative richard raymond dlaredo those three districts share big chunks of bexar county austin will have a special election to replace representative todd baxter in hd48 before a special session on school finance governor rick perry called that election for january 17 a runoff if one takes place would take place in february baxter a republican quit at the beginning of november and took a job as a cable tv lobbyist ben bentzin is the only republican whos said out loud that he wants the job four democrats are looking at it andy brown donna howard kathy rider and kelly white bentzin lost a senate race against gonzalo barrientos daustin four years ago white lost to baxter by a few dozen votes two years ago the democrats have had conversations  without resolution apparently  about going into a special election with just one candidate instead of four and no matter who wins in january the candidates who want a full term in the job will be on the ballot for party primaries in march and the general election in november the special election winner could have an edge and will get to vote in a special session on school finance in his announcement of the special election perry cited the pending special session and the june 1 deadline set by the supreme court for a remedy to what they called an unconstitutional statewide property tax howards campaign points out that the runup to this special contest includes four holidays  christmas hanukkah new years and martin luther kings birthday itll be tricky for candidates to do politics in the last two weeks of december in particular since baxter announced his resignation democrats have been grousing about perrys slow hand replacing the late representative joe moreno dhouston who was killed last spring in a truck accident the special election to replace him was set for election day in november a runoff will be held in a couple of weeks well after two special sessions on school finance with several close votes on various school finance provisions that empty seat threw a real advantage to republican house leaders with the shoe on the other foot democrats complain perry is moving quickly to try to replace baxters lost republican vote with another republican another difference between the two situations is the courts firm june 1 deadline but school finance has been sufficiently troubled to prompt perry to call three special sessions without any word from the supremes early voting is now underway as of november 30 in that houston runoff to replace moreno in the legislature election day is saturday december 10 ana hernandez and laura salinas finished first and second respectively in a sixcandidate field the four losers in the first round endorsed salinas who has the backing of some former legislators in houston hernandez is backed by morenos family and several current legislators both democrats are running with significant contributions from normally conservative financiers like houston homebuilder bob perry and texans for lawsuit reform and the winner will have to defend the seat in normal elections next year representative mary denny raubrey announced she wont run for reelection next year but will serve out her current term denny chairs the house elections committee and has been a member since 1993 she was chairman of denton countys republican party before that in a written statement denny said she is concerned about her husbands health and wants to spend more time with him two republicans were already planning to run even with denny in the race ricky grunden who lives in krum and works in denton as a financial adviser hasnt run for office before anne lakusta of flower mound is a former member of the lewisville isd board another tan parker of flower mound has launched an exploratory campaign  hes a regional exec with computer sciences corporation no democrats have surfaced yet to steal a line from former house speaker gib lewis its time to chirp or get off the perch candidates for state office in 2006 can start filing on saturday december 3 and must file by the end of the day on monday january 2 to be on the march ballot unless something pops 2006 will be a relatively calm election year in texas of the 215 people elected to legislative jobs in texas were including the 34 feds only 17 definitely wont be back and a bunch have their fingers crossed hoping theyll run unopposed next year none of the 32 members of the states congressional delegation have indicated anything other than reelection bids and only three challenges  at this point  have the makings of potentially serious contests us representatives tom delay rsugar land chet edwards dwaco and henry cuellar dlaredo cuellars in a primary fight but the other two have 11 months left before voters put an end to the suspense the texas senate has three open seats out of 31 and possibly one more  depending on the unannounced reelection plans of senator ken armbrister dvictoria sens gonzalo barrientos daustin jon lindsay rhouston and todd staples rpalestine wont be back lindsay staples and armbrister are all committee chairs armbristers hd18 could flip to the gop lightning could strike but each of the other three will probably remain with the party thats now in place the house should have 20 to 30 interesting races but only has 14 empty seats out of 150 put an asterisk there  youll see more dropouts as candidates actually file for reelection at this writing the list of departed and departing house members includes ray allen rgrand prairie todd baxter raustin mary denny raubrey bob griggs rnorth richland hills peggy hamric rhouston ruben hope jr rconroe bob hunter rabilene suzanna gratia hupp rlampasas terry keel raustin joe moreno dhouston deceased joe nixon rhouston richard raymond dlaredo jim solis dharlingen carlos uresti dsan antonio half of those  allen denny hamric hupp keel nixon and uresti  are committee chairmen house speaker tom craddick wont appoint any house members to a joint committee to work on school finance and education issues though he and lieutenant governor david dewhurst had previously agreed on the number and even the names of legislators who would be on it aides to both men were ready to announce the joint panel  with seven members from each side  as soon as the texas supreme court announced a decision in the school finance case that decision landed on the tuesday before thanksgiving but the committee never was unveiled though members were contacted about serving on it both in the house and in the senate and in a written statement craddick says hes now against the idea i have spoken to lt governor david dewhurst and i do not think it is necessary to appoint a joint select committee on public education governor perry appointed his texas tax reform commission to which each of us contributed nominations for appointees that committee is made up of a diverse group of individuals and we need to support that group in coming up with different funding mechanisms for public school finance i look forward to then working with the lt governor and the senate on developing a consensus plan that responds to the supreme courts ruling  when they were talking about a legislative committee legislative leaders were working with the idea that the sharp panel would make recommendations but wouldnt be able to vote on anything dewhurst stung by perrys appointment of the democrat dewhurst beat in 2002 wanted to put his imprint on the issue and lawmakers might want to add their own stuff  particularly in the realm of education reforms from the east end of the capitol craddicks decision looks like a second slap they might also be better off working out their plans before the start of a special session the task force formed by perry doesnt have any lawmakers on it as it stands lawmakers will get to work on the issues at the start of a special session sometime between now and the supreme courts june 1 deadline representative pete gallego dalpine sent a letter to bill ceverha and to the press and others asking the former legislator and lobbyist to resign from his position at the employee retirement system of texas ceverha the former treasurer for texans for a republican majority lost a civil suit stemming from trmpacs activities in the 2004 election and cited the judgments against him when he declared personal bankruptcy a few weeks ago gallego in his letter says ceverha ought to quit the pension board in light of his own financial problems among other things representative jim dunnam dwaco and texans for public justice also joined the call for ceverhas head ceverha called gallegos letter silly and said he and the other members of the ers board dont make investment decisions he was confirmed by the texas senate with votes from senators of both political parties he said pointing out that the vote came after the civil trial on trmpac it did come after the trial but senators voted before the verdict was announced and the judge in the case ruled against ceverha ceverha said he owed some 850000 in legal and court fees and that combined with pending litigation on related issues pushed him to seek bankruptcy protection he called gallego a highly partisan individual and said hes hanging more of my laundry out in public but he said he has no intention of resigning and he reiterated that his personal finances have no bearing on the state gig we dont make investment decisions and its silly to think that we do he said senior judge pat priest the man in black in us representative tom delays campaign finance trial plans to rule by tuesday of next week on delays request to drop the charges if the case goes ahead delay is still pressing a change of venue to get the trial moved out of austin and also has filed papers contending prosecutors abused the grand jury process to get the former house majority leader indicted priest has already said he doubts delay could get to trial before the end of the year the congressman wants to put the matter to rest before congress reconvenes and possibly elects new leaders hes not eligible for a top post while under indictment the judge said hell decide on deadlines and such for other motions andor a trial depending on what he does with this first piece in some editions last week we said changing the property tax cap would require a constitutional amendment it would not require an amendment or a public vote the legislature can change that 150 cap as it wishes and without voter approval sorry sorry sorry  we offered up a muddy explanation of some education stats last week so well attempt a clarification in his testimony to the governors task force on taxes steve murdock the states demographer offered some numbers showing texas behind other states and the national average in both high school diplomas and college degrees the details in the year 2000 757 percent of texas adults age 25 and up had high school degrees that was a lower percentage than 44 other states and lower than the national percentage of 804 percent likewise 232 percent of those same texas adults had college degrees lower than the national rate  244 percent  and the rates of 26 other states murdock was clear and we werent sorry for any confusion we ignited austin political consultant john colyandro is off the hook in a federal civil case stemming from the 2002 elections democrats kirk watson and mike head sued colyandro and the law enforcement alliance of america for allegedly funneling corporate money into the campaign chests of their republican opponents but us district judge lee yeakel released colyandro from the suit saying he found no actionable or unlawful conduct  leaa is still in it though watson who ran for attorney general against greg abbott and head who ran for a texas house seat contend the leaa worked on behalf of their opponents without disclosing the identities of donors and that the group used corporate money illegally in that effort brian keith walker a republican attorney from panola county who used to be an assistant sergeantatarms in the texas senate is running for the texas house seat currently occupied by representative chuck hopson djacksonville walker will have to win a primary first mike alberts who lost narrowly to hopson in 2004 has already declared judge sid harle of san antonio is joining the state commission on judicial conduct he was appointed to that judgejudging panel by the texas supreme court kathy ward a former high school teacher who had been vice chair of the collin county gop is the new chairman rick neudorff resigned to run for collin county judge james baril is leaving

a rural road during the thanksgiving break representative rob eissler rthe woodlands and a former school board member talking about school finance in the dallas morning news there are competing visions one is give us more money and get out of the way the legislature has said hey we realize more money will help the situation but its not the only answer we want more accountability dick lavine with the center for public policy priorities telling the el paso times that higher efficiency will help public schools but wont solve everything you can do a lot more with money than you can do without money  house public education chairman kent grusendorf quoted in the san antonio expressnews on reports that school districts spent 43 million on lawyers in the school finance case i dont think its appropriate to use tax dollars to sue the taxpayers for more taxpayer money  representative anna mowery rfort worth telling the fort worth startelegram shes heard from her constituents about school finance they told me dont give the fort worth school district another penny they either steal it or waste it premed student adriana gonzalez talking to the brownsville herald after hearing

March Lions, November Lambs	2005-11-21	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2005/11/21/march-lions-november-lambs/	en	what once looked like a frolic for a political junkie in texas  a year with contested statewide races all up and down the ballot with stars running for governor and us senate and on and on  now looks more like a quiet night at home the guvs race will be noisy in march and probably again in november but all else is pretty quiet in the top spots on the ballot redistricting has taken the juice out of all but a handful of congressional and state senate elections only the texas house  which still has a few swing districts and where primaries could be roiled by messy school finance and tax issues  appears to offer much for the politically minded observer and in many instances thats subtler than the usual r v d setup texas is in a period when the most interesting competition of ideas and candidates comes in the march primaries  particularly on the republican side only two members of the texas congressional delegation won with less than 55 percent of the general election vote in 2004 chet edwards dwaco who got 512 percent and pete sessions rdallas who came in at 543 percent edwards in cd17 is on most lists of incumbents on thin ice in 2006 at least two republicans are battling for the nomination to take him on and therell be national money on both sides in that contest one resident of the district when hes not in the white house is george w bush several members of congress got there after tough primaries for the most part those were creatures of redistricting rather than continuing competitive districts but democrat henry cuellar dlaredo has both a rematch opponent and a newcomer in former us representative ciro rodriguez dsan antonio and state representative richard raymond dlaredo it went to a recount in 2004 and its a real contest next year the closest race for the texas senate two years ago had a 17point spread between the republican and the democrat and the only close race was in a democratic primary won by the incumbent mario gallegos dhouston with 539 percent none of those districts is likely to flip from one party to the other but senators serve fouryear terms you have to look at the 2002 elections to see whats going on in districts held by senators up in 2006 if youre looking for fights thats not much more encouraging in 2002 three senators got less than 55 percent of the vote in the general election bob deuell rgreenville who was knocking off an incumbent democrat david cain of dallas gonzalo barrientos daustin fending off a wellfinanced republican challenger who got some mileage out of a dwi charge against the incumbent and ken armbrister dvictoria who got 533 percent of the vote in a district that votes for republicans in most other races on the ballot barrientos isnt seeking reelection next year and democrat kirk watson a former austin mayor and current chamber of commerce honcho is the preemptive favorite to replace him right now armbrister hasnt said for sure whether hell run for reelection next year theres been a new rumor every week about it  that hell run that hell quit and lobby that hell go work for governor rick perry as liaison to the lege  and his aides give cloudy answers when asked about his future their boss has scheduled a fundraiser for next month but has been slow to send out invitations and they say hell make his announcement one way or the other in his own time probably when filing for office begins next month republicans meanwhile are lining up to see if they can do better against him than lester phipps who got 45 percent in 2002 in the 2002 primaries juan chuy hinojosa dmcallen went through a tight primary and then a runoff to get to his first term in the upper chamber and republican tommy williams also survived with less than 55 percent in the gop primary those races probably contain no omens though both men were house members running for senate seats that had been redrawn in redistricting and neither faced an incumbent though williams opponent was michael galloway a former state senator in the 2002 primaries the only senator who had a real race had a real race jeff wentworth rsan antonio staved off a challenge from representative john shields wentworth escaped the primary with a 1216vote margin out of 51246 votes cast boil that down to present tense there are at this juncture three tough races in the texas congressional delegation and one in the texas senate edwards occupies a target area for both national parties hell be alone in march while at least two republicans battle for their nomination but itll be an important contest in november cuellars cd28 has to be considered an open race at least in march another race depends on how the ball bounces us representative tom delay rsugar land got just over 55 percent in 2004 hell face former us representative nick lampson in the general election but that race has more to do with national politics and courthouse troubles than with district lines its republican turf under most circumstances in the state senate armbrister generally votes with the gop but some in that party want to put a republican in office in sd18 if he runs hell have a race and the republicans will have a contest in march either way to the extent theres much action on the ballot next year it will be in house races and because of redistricting and its tendency to give comfort to incumbents of both parties much of the fun stuff will happen in march rather than in november four democrats in the house got there after primary runoffs in 2004 three  yvonne gonzalez toureilles of alice veronica gonzales of mcallen and abel herrero of corpus christi  beat incumbents herrero in the first round the others in the runoff david mcquade leibowitz of san antonio won his runoff after surviving a crowded primary election and beat the incumbent republican in the general election none of the four got less than 55 percent in their runoff rob orr rburleson won a runoff against an imploding opponent sam walls led the first round but his campaign died when pictures of him in womens clothing went public orr was the only republican house member who got there by way of a runoff in 2004 several members got into the house with less than comfortable margins and could be potential targets next year charles doc anderson rwaco got 504 percent in the gop primary and then got 532 percent in the general election hell have a primary opponent and the democrats see a chance no other republican got less than 55 percent in the primary armando mando martinez dweslaco beat an incumbent in the primary getting 53 percent of the vote marc veasey dfort worth beat an incumbent with 542 percent alma allen dhouston beat an incumbent with 554 percent in the general election stephen frost datlanta got in with 528 percent mark homer dparis got 502 percent chuck hopson djacksonville got 527 percent jim mcreynolds dlufkin got 51 percent robby cook deagle lake decided to run for reelection after announcing he wouldnt and considering a party change he ended up with 5366 percent john otto rdayton had 545 percent mike tuffy hamilton rmauriceville had 554 percent herrero after that primary runoff got 55 percent in the general gonzalez toureilles got out of the general with 509 percent patrick rose ddripping springs had 545 percent todd baxter raustin he resigned his seat to become a cable lobbyist and wont be on the ballot next year had 501 percent andersons general election win was 532 percent david farabee dwichita falls got 53 percent tony goolsby rdallas got 531 percent ray allen rgrand prairie got out with 525 percent hes not running for reelection next year leibowitz won his general election with 506 percent of the vote martha wong rhouston had 535 percent and hubert vo dhouston got 50 percent and won by less than three dozen votes if you were trying to put together a map of next years races there are two ways to look at those past results if a name has a d next to it and a narrow margin in 2004 put that on the target list for republicans flip the letter and the party affiliation and thats the democrats first list now look at it from the perspective of the party leaders on either side if one of your reps didnt look so hot in 2004 and if you really need the seat find them a primary opponent or talk them off the ballot if one of the reps on your side voted with your enemies add them to the target list one more factor  education  will make ten to twenty races interesting next year school superintendents and current and former school board members are signing up in a bunch of races some of thats normal  the pool of new lowlevel state candidates comes from school boards city councils county commissions and the like  but part of it is a reaction to the proposed solutions to school finance in the regular and special sessions earlier this year educators and other community leader types are also popping up in districts where the school finance votes that made sense in austin dont look as good at home some rural members for instance are getting questioned about voting against bigger homestead exemptions that would have benefited the folks back home and some members are getting peppered at home for not going along with state leaders who were trying to find a solution if all that amounts to anything it could have a real influence on school finance the legislature that survives these elections could take up the issue in the next regular session in january 2007 and if theres a special session on school finance next spring the results of the primary elections will be fresh on everyones minds us representative tom delays lawyers want a quick trial if theres to be any trial at all according to court papers delays indictment on campaign financerelated charges cost him his post as house majority leader at least temporarily and his lawyers say the best way to get back into leadership is to get the charges thrown out or to win exoneration in a speedy trial judge pat priest will get his first crack at the case next week when he hears two requests from delay one they want the charges dropped or barring that a december trial setting and two if theres to be a trial they want it held outside of travis county home field to district attorney ronnie earle and a place where voters and presumably jurors are on average democrats theyd like to have it in fort bend county the decidedly republican locale thats partly represented in congress by delay in papers filed with the court delays lawyers say the indictment fails to specify what law hes accused of breaking they say the charges are vague and involve provisions of state law that werent in effect when his alleged crimes took place their argument is that conspiracy and election code violations arent linked in the law or werent at that time and that they are linked in the indictment for that reason they contend the indictment ought to be tossed they also want to see internal papers from the district attorneys investigation of delay and have asked for any evidence of dissent within earles office about the charges against delay and they accuse the prosecutors of manipulating three grand juries to produce delays indictment the prosecutors filed papers spelling out their version of what happened with the grand juries and said delays lawyers havent given good enough legal reasons to open the grand jurys secret proceedings to public view finally the defense issued subpoenas asking the members of one of those three grand juries to be in court when all of these motions are heard top it with this court tv has asked for permission to bring cameras into the courtroom for delays trial john hills appearance as a witness for us representative tom delay rsugar land bugged the democratic party so much that its asking reporters to stop identifying their former standard bearer as a democrat hill a former texas supreme court justice secretary of state attorney general and democratic candidate for governor he lost to bill clements in 1978 was brought in by delays lawyers to talk about his view that state district judge bob perkins should be removed from delays case perkins contributed to democrats and to some national organizations that in one case took some shots at delay delays lawyers squawked testimony including hills was heard perkins got the boot and in the stories about it hill was referred to as a democrat the state democratic executive committee answered that by passing a resolution that says hill hasnt voted in one of the partys primaries since 1994 and that thats the only way someone declares allegiance to a political party in this state the resolution from the sdec respectfully asks members of the texas press to stop referring to mr hill as a democrat when he testifies for and supports high profile republicans in controversial matters such as the tom delaytrmpac criminal case  they ended it with a plea to democrats who supported a republican or two in the past to come vote in their primary in march hill says he does not care to comment efforts to pull horse racing lottery slot machine and casino interests together into a texans for tourism group have hit what looks like a cement wall ricky knox who was in the middle of earlier fights for parimutuel gambling and the lottery got 100 people into a hotel conference room in september to pitch the idea but knox who didnt return calls sent out an angry letter to interested parties saying track owners and potential track owners had blown up the cooperation racket because it worked against their own interests in the emails he said hed met with sam phelps and scott phelps of alabama  theyre principals in the gulf greyhound track near houston  and that theyd told him they dont want to pursue efforts to legalize video lottery machines until 2011 our calls to alabama like those to knox went unreturned knox was trying to unify the states gambling interests in advance of the 2007 regular session of the legislature among other things that would mean getting track owners running in the same direction his emails on the subject indicate theyre not ready to do that  we were gaining momentum on a daily basis in fact it was amazing how many positive things were happening  but we all knew at any moment mr greed would surface and kill the effort today  mr greed won knox wrote efforts to legalize casinos are still underway but quiet the let the voters decide group still wants lawmakers to put casinos on the ballot to see whether voters would go along with the idea and its too early to start carving the tombstone for vlts promoters of various forms of gambling will be watching to see what the texas supreme court says on school finance and then on what governor rick perrys tax task force does in response if more money is required or if business taxpayers strongly resist efforts to lessen homeowners burdens at business expense gambling could move up on the popularity charts racing and the lottery grew out of finance problems in the 1980s and 1990s texas lawmakers arent always crazy about gambling but there are any number of taxes they love even less and theyve always covered their bets leaving the final say to voters in the form of constitutional amendments groups that oppose gambling expansion in texas  the texas eagle forum for instance  are paying close attention they sent an alert to members after knoxs missive made the rounds urging their folks to contact members of the legislature to try to get expanded gambling off the list of tax relief options the texas lottery commission has a new applicant for executive director former house appropriations committee chairman talmadge heflin who served 22 years as a state representative from houston officials with the lottery say heflins application came in late  after the brass hats there were down to four candidates for the job but they havent made their final decision yet and theyve said all along theyd consider all comers that was the second time in a week heflin blipped on the governmentpolitical radar screen the former lawmaker is going on the payroll for the texas public policy foundation hell be working on state budget issues which suits him because of his years on appropriations including a session as chairman he and others at the think tank will be trying to figure out how state spending plans inflated by 187 percent earlier this year and how spending can be cut next time the lege meets his official title at tppf is visiting research fellow heflin said a few weeks ago hell run for office next year trying to take back the seat he lost by a handful of votes in 2004 to representative hubert vo dhouston a spokesman for tppf says theres no prenuptial agreement in heflins hiring his bid for office wont affect his job unless some conflict of interest appears the lotto gig would disqualify him for the elected post should he show up as a state employee knock him off your prospects list not long after the texas supreme court rules on the school finance case lieutenant governor david dewhurst and house speaker tom craddick will fire up a committee of legislators to come up with new plans for school finance and property tax relief youll notice some overlap there with the 24member group of nonlegislators corralled by governor rick perry to look at state tax policy perrys panel headed by former comptroller john sharp doesnt have any lawmakers on it and school finance isnt part of its charter dewhurst and craddick want lawmakers to do a quick autopsy on the court opinion to figure out what needs fixing and what can be left alone they havent released the names of the members yet but theyve tentatively pulled together a list of seven senators and seven representatives wholl try to come up with something that the legislature can pass and that the courts will approve the idea is to see if the people wholl actually vote on any changes in state law can get together on some fixes theyd be able to include  or exclude  whatever work comes out of perrys task force in preparation for a special session on education andor taxes when might that special session take place nobody in a position to know is emitting information about it but politics point to sometime after the party primaries in march and experience  some new and some old  would suggest sometime before the school year is over when schools are out teachers and administrators are freer to come to austin to lobby lawmakers that was a wellknown bit of folklore in the mid to late1980s after sweeping school reforms were pushed through the legislature it was lost to some over time but after two failed special sessions this past summer recharged the lore its part of the calculation again the four candidates wiped out in the first round of a special election in hd143 are all endorsing the secondplace finisher laura salinas over the firstround winner ana hernandez al flores rick molina charles george and dorothy olmos who finished 3rd 4th 5th and 6th respectively each signed on with salinas hernandez got 43 percent on election day hernandez got 26 percent the votes of the other four pooled would have put a candidate in second place with 32 percent if all those people were to vote and if all of them were to follow their candidates into salinas camp shed win a runoff with 57 percent and if wishes were horses wed need more hay around here the money in the race continues to be interesting when we looked at the 30day reports last month salinas biggest contribution had come from texans for lawsuit reform a republicanleaning political action committee that had given her 15000 the biggest check to hernandez was from houston builder bob perry the biggest single contributor to texas republican candidates in 2004 and a big contributor to tlr having donated more than 600000 to their efforts since 2000 as the election drew closer tlr gave salinas another 50000 and she borrowed a total of 55200 to finance the effort the loans are guaranteed by former representative roman martinez dhouston hes married to former representative diana davila salinas aunt the texas trial lawyers association  the hatfields to tlrs mccoys  gave 29250 to hernandez in the last month she got help from several officeholders and from the family of the late representative joe moreno whose death prompted the special election she also got financial help from some officeholders including 5000 from senator rodney ellis dhouston 114223 from harris county commissioner sylvia garcia and 210021 from constable gary freemans campaign the runoff election isnt official yet but the campaigns are aiming at saturday december 10 todd baxter who quit the texas house a couple of weeks ago is the new lobbyist for the texas cable tv association baxter an austin republican dropped out of a competitive race for reelection last month saying he wanted to concentrate on work and familiy he recently left an austin law firm and is signing on as tctas general counsel and vice president for government affairs governor rick perry hasnt picked a date for the special election to replace baxter he can wait until the next available election date for these things  thats in may  or declare it an emergency and call an election for almost any date he chooses it cant coincide with the primary elections or the primary election runoffs republican ben bentzin is so far the only republican seeking the seat four democrats are talking about it andy brown donna howard kathy rider and kelly white former legislator and judge bob gammage is talking to friends around the state to see whether hes got the support to run in the democratic primary for governor gammage was on the texas supreme court and the 3rd court of appeals and served in congress and in the texas house and senate he sent an email around to test the waters suggesting there that democrats need more options next year  democrat chris bell the best known of the two democrats who have already decided to run the other is felix alvarado a fort worth educator got an endorsement for his gubernatorial campaign from state senator juan chuy hinojosa dmcallen  governor

A Political Upside-Down Cake	2005-11-14	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2005/11/14/a-political-upside-down-cake/	en	remember in the comics how  whenever they ran out of ideas  theyd throw superman or some other hero into an alternate parallel universe that memory came instantly to mind when we saw the results of two polls done for the texas credit union league they hired a republican pollster to talk to primary voters of the red persuasion and a democratic pollster to talk to the blues they found two distinctly different parallel worlds but first the news republican voters asked how theyd vote in a primary held today picked rick perry 61 percent of the time and carole keeton strayhorn 26 percent of the time asked how they feel about the two 79 percent had a somewhat favorable or very favorable impression of perry and 50 percent had very or somewhat favorable impressions of strayhorn the negatives on perrys ledger add up to 18 percent with gop primary voters strayhorns total 25 percent put another way perrys chumtochump ratio is 4to1 strayhorns is 2to1 democratic voters asked how theyd vote in a primary held today picked chris bell 28 percent of the time and felix alvarado 15 percent of the time most  57 percent  told the pollsters theyre undecided democrats arent fond of the governor or of president george w bush  not surprising since those are republicans  but they give another prominent republican us senator kay bailey hutchison good marks with 53 percent saying they have a favorable impression of her and 43 percent saying their impression is unfavorable the republican firm of voterconsumer research talked to 400 texas gop primary voters october 2426 and say their margin of error is  49 percent the democratic pollsters hamilton beattie  staff did the same thing 403 voters same dates same margin of error the sponsors let us post the polls on the website download them from our files section or click on these links to get to them  tcul democratic primary poll  tcul republican primary poll they didnt ask about general election horse races but the pollsters found big differences between each partys voters lookit  ask republicans about the direction of the state and 58 percent say its going in the right direction 27 percent disagree their top issues at the moment starting at the top of the list illegal immigration moral values education taxes health care the budget deficit abortion jobs political scandals and growth  congestion theres a notable drop in interest on the items in that list below taxes ask the gop voters about their top priorities for the guv and the legislature and you get this stopping illegal immigration improving our schools reducing property taxes strengthening families and improving moral values cutting government spending and campaign finance reform  64 percent of texas democrats  out of power in every branch of state government and in their federal congressional delegation to boot  think the states going the wrong way 23 percent disagree their issues starting with the highest ranked education health care and prescription drug costs taxes the budget deficit illegal immigration crime and drugs jobs the environment and growth  congestion the drop in interest in this group was after drug costs  republicans have a marginally good impression of the legislature 54 percent have very or somewhat favorable impressions of the people in the statehouse those numbers improve if you ask how the republicans in the lege are doing instead of just talking generically about the legislature slightly more than half 51 think their own lawmakers deserve reelection and a third want to give someone else a chance democrats do the same thing giving good numbers to democrats in the statehouse and lower numbers to the opposition 42 percent say theyd vote for their incumbent and 27 percent say theyd vote for a challenger  democratic voters told the pollsters theyre more interested in results than fights only 15 percent listed fighting with the republican leadership in austin as one of their top priorities that ranked behind getting things done working on public education problems restoring ethics in government and being bipartisan and getting along with republicans  ask gop primary voters about public education and 54 percent say they arent willing to pay higher taxes for improvements another 39 percent say they would be willing but if they could do only one of the following 53 percent said theyd prevent deep cuts in education and 40 percent say theyd want a lawmaker to prevent all tax increases half the democrats  49 percent  say education funding should come from closing loopholes in corporate taxes after that 16 percent say wasteful spending should be cut 13 percent say some form of gambling should be considered and one in ten say the state should have an income tax income taxes finished at 10 percent  ahead of the 8 percent who said higher sales taxes should be in the mix almost three in five democrats say the state should spend more on public schools 39 percent say the spending levels are right and that schools should be more accountable about what they spend  state funding for protecting borders against terrorism actually a federal chore is too low according to 72 percent of republican voters almost half  48 percent  say funding for public education is too low but only 16 percent say the state is spending too little on higher education twothirds are happy with current spending on roads and public transportation and 43 percent thing spending on state health care programs is about right one in five thinks the state is spending too much on colleges and universities 17 percent think health care spending is too high and one in ten wants to cut back on public education spending  who do republicans trust for news cable tv followed by talk radio broadcast tv local newspapers friends and family and the internet in that order pollster jan van lohuizen says the respondents mean fox news when they say cable tv and said that with only 11 percent saying they trust their local papers the inkstained wretches of the world should shiver who do the democrats rely on for news about politics in order broadcast news cable news and local newspapers voters approved seven of the nine constitutional amendments on the ballot giving overwhelming support to two in particular one that would allow courts to deny bail for some accused criminals and one that would outlaw marriage between samesex couples the results including the language voters were looking at when they voted  prop 1 the constitutional amendment creating the texas rail relocation and improvement fund and authorizing grants of money and issuance of obligations for financing the relocation rehabilitation and expansion of rail facilities   prop 2 the constitutional amendment providing that marriage in this state consists only of the union of one man and one woman and prohibiting this state or a political subdivision of this state from creating or recognizing any legal status identical or similar to marriage  as a ballot measure samesex marriage civil union and anything that looks like marriage between anything but a woman and a man is dead until twothirds of the legislature and a majority of voters say otherwise the gay marriage amendment was approved by 1712823 voters or 762 percent the issue which appears headed for the courts drew the most voters of anything on the ballot 2248076 people voted  119597 more than voted on any of the other amendments a telling statistic by the time early voting was over 505429 people had already voted to add proposition 2 the gay marriage amendment to the texas constitution that was only 29917 votes short of what was ultimately needed for approval  535345 people voted against the amendment in early and election day voting the winners needed just under 30000 of the 12 million votes they brought out on tuesday  prop 3 the constitutional amendment clarifying that certain economic development programs do not constitute a debt  this one had the smallest winning margin at 518 percent  prop 4 the constitutional amendment authorizing the denial of bail to a criminal defendant who violates a condition of the defendants release pending trial  the most popular measure on the ballot both in raw numbers 1805343 votes and percentage approval 848 percent  prop 6 the constitutional amendment to include one additional public member and a constitutional county court judge in the membership of the state commission on judicial conduct  this finished with 626 percent approval  prop 7 the constitutional amendment authorizing lineofcredit advances under a reverse mortgage  598 percent of the voters approved  prop 8 the constitutional amendment providing for the clearing of land titles by relinquishing and releasing any state claim to sovereign ownership or title to interest in certain land in upshur county and in smith county  passed with 61 percent it also drew the lowest number of votes of any amendment  373511 fewer than for the top vote getter prop 2 voters rejected two amendments to the constitution that would have uncapped interest rates on commercial loans and extended board members at regional mobility authorities  prop 5 the constitutional amendment allowing the legislature to define rates of interest for commercial loans  got 434 percent approval according to uncertified returns  prop 9 the constitutional amendment authorizing the legislature to provide for a sixyear term for a board member of a regional mobility authority  got only 466 percent of the vote a runoff election will decide one of two open seats in the texas house ana hernandez and laura salinas finished first and second in a sixperson pack to replace the late joe moreno dhouston turnout was skimpy with 6170 voters turning out hernandez got 2624 or 425 percent in the full but unofficial count salinas got 1590 votes or 257 percent the runoff date wont be set until after the votes are canvassed according to the texas secretary of state fresh proof that special elections dont draw crowds like regular elections do moreno won office last november with 93 percent of the 14307 votes cast the other empty seat wasnt on the ballot november 1 was the first day out of office for representative todd baxter raustin who resigned to pursue unspecified opportunities elsewhere governor rick perry hasnt called a special election for that post the next nonemergency election date available for that contest is in may add ray allen rgrand prairie to the list of house members not coming back that total is at this writing up to 13 and a maybe and candidates dont have to finally commit until the first days of the new year allen who heads the house committee on county affairs and used to chair the corrections committee was one of several republican chairs targeted by democrats in the 2004 elections he was also one of the survivors beating democrat katy hubener by 1841 votes he was likely to be on the hit list again but decided not to run for reelection in hd106 hes finishing his seventh term in the house so you dont have to look it up heres the current list of members who wont be here for the next regular session starting with republicans allen todd baxter of austin bob griggs of north richland hills peggy hamric of houston ruben hope jr of conroe bob hunter of abilene suzanna gratia hupp of lampasas terry keel of austin joe nixon of houston the democrats the late joe moreno of houston richard raymond of laredo jim solis of harlingen count carlos uresti of san antonio who has said hes considering either a bid for senate or for reelection as a maybe charles soechting says he wont seek another term as chairman of the texas democratic party in a note to members of the state democratic executive committee and an interview he said he wants to spend more time practicing law and raising kids he also said you could make book on him seeking elective office in the future soechting a hays county lawyer was chairman of the county party before he followed molly beth malcolm into the state chairmanship he said hell have served three years when his term ends and that he doesnt want to do two more years when that time comes the election is in june and two names are floating around at the moment as possible candidates boyd richie an attorney in graham in north texas and dennis teal a chiropractor from livingston in east texas soechting says he doesnt intend to back a particular candidate but doesnt completely rule it out the party got a reboot this fall when a small group that includes dallas lawyer fred baron and consultant matt angle unveiled a reorganization plan for the democrats tied to a badly needed infusion of cash soechting says his departure wasnt a condition of that but says it gave him a higher comfort level about leaving next year texans contributed 144250 to no on 77 a group opposing californias redistricting efforts that measure pushed by republican governor arnold schwarzenegger was opposed by democrats and 595 percent of the golden states voters were against it on election day texans gave 2767 to reform ohio now a liberal group that was pushing for a similar change in that state though the measures were slightly different their intentions were similar and voters in ohio like their counterparts in the pacific time zone rejected the change in ohio 70 percent said no we were peeking at those propositions because they were inspired by the middecade redistricting that made texas politics so much fun during 2003 and 2004 if you just tuned in the lone star state has become the poster child for redistricting reformers from both parties the middecade plans drawn before the 2004 elections caught the attention of political cartographers across the us in the texas episode republicans first won the majority of seats in the legislature and then used that majority to reopen congressional redistricting long story short they flipped the color of the states congressional delegation from blue to red the case is pending before the us supreme court which is deciding whether to hear arguments the opposition to the california proposition ran one ad featuring a group of judges cutting and pasting their state into new political lines at the end of the tv commercial they unveil their work a map of texas that says california across it in both states the effort to depoliticize redistricting was driven by one set of partisans and opposed by the other and both efforts were expensive though the california libs spent more at about 15 million than the ohio libs who spent around 17 million one interesting factlet from california was the number of democrats from the texas congressional delegation who contributed 1000 us representatives al green gene green and sheila jackson lee all from houston eddie bernice johnson of dallas solomon ortiz of corpus christi silvestre reyes of el paso and ruben hinojosa of mcallen none of the 88 texas contributors to the ohio group gave more than 100 and none are members of congress governor rick perrys tax committee  chaired by democrat john sharp  is taking some hits from democrats who say some regular folks should have been sprinkled in among the ceos and other highflyers representative garnet coleman dhouston and senator eliot shapleigh del paso both say the governor should have included some homeowners along with all the business folk more quietly some business lobbyists have noted the absence of some big taxpayers among the industries represented on the panel car dealers at odds with perry are out manufacturing commercial real estate the internet end of the technology business and utilities will all be relying on allies instead of their own guys shapleigh whos been all over texas evangelizing for a personal income tax to support state services says perry and sharp  by taking that tax out of consideration  killed chances for significant reform hes predicting the sharp panel will produce more of what lawmakers have already seen new business taxes and higher taxes on consumption the panel is in a hurry theyll have their first meeting on monday november 21 in the bowels of the pink building the appropriations room that first deal will likely be a dogandpony show but by most accounts theyre getting to work quickly theyll need to have recommendations ready for a possible special session sometime after the march primaries followup the list of tax task force members we ran last week was unofficial and as we said at the time incomplete add these names to those prentice gary managing partner of carleton residential properties in dallas and victor leal of canyon owner of a chain of four family restaurants in the panhandle and make one amendment to last weeks list howard wolf is no longer an attorney from houston though that was once true he retired from fulbright and jaworski and now has a solo practice in austin he also serves on a couple of boards stewart  stevenson services and simmons  co international robert howden a former aide to governor rick perry who has done freelance lobbying worked for the texas association of automobile dealers and the texas office of the national federation of independent business will be the staff director for whats been officially dubbed the texas tax reform commission  howdens unhappy parting with the car dealers is a part of the saga that explains why they dont have any members on the task force another factor was their support for sharp over perry in the 1998 race for lieutenant governor the policy chops on the task force will be provided by karey barton and james lebas two former comptroller employees brought in for their subject matter expertise lebas now the cfo for the texas water development board was chief revenue estimator for comptroller carole keeton strayhorn barton most recently a tax consultant was director of state tax policy for strayhorn and for two of her predecessors sharp and the late bob bullock the states top civil jurist refused to recuse himself from picking a judge for tom delays trial today saying theres nobody else to do the job and saying the proper target of a recusal motion is a trial judge and not the guy who picks him in a letter to the lawyers in that case texas supreme court chief justice wallace jefferson said his selection of san antonio senior judge pat priest will stand jefferson said he cant find anything in the law that requires him to step aside and wrote that i have a duty to ensure that the judicial process is not paralyzed any time a recusal motion challenges a judicial officer who is performing a purely administrative function  if they lawyers dont like priest they can challenge him jefferson wrote the recourse is to challenge not the power to assign but the assignment itself  priests first hearing is set for november 22 hell likely be hearing delays request for a change of venue the congressmans lawyers say travis county has heard too much poisonous stuff about the case and that the people in the states capital city are too liberal they want the trial moved to delays home county fort bend one more note state district judge bob perkins removed from delays case voluntary recused himself from the trials of delays codefendants john colyandro and jim ellis hardeman county commissioner johnny akers pleaded guilty to shortstopping ballots in the 2004 primary and general elections in which he was elected he told some voters there hed help them out by picking up their ballots and delivering them to the proper folks thats illegal ed strayhorn husband of texas comptroller and gubernatorial candidate carole keeton strayhorn had some kind of incident or seizure while on a hunting trip with friends in south texas and was taken to valley baptist hospital in harlingen hes now at home and a spokesman said hes fine and that the doctors are still poking and prodding to find out what happened representative warren chisum rpampa talking to the houston chronicle about the success of a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage thats where the victory was won from the pulpits of the state of texas  rev ryan rush senior pastor of bannockburn baptist church in austin talking to the associated press after that vote if that becomes a trend the evangelical community becomes the largest political voice not only in the state of texas but america i think thats a positive thing because evangelical christians stand for whats right  kelly shackelford of the free market foundation quoted in the dallas morning news on the push for a national version this is a pretty strong message to congress and the senate before they vote on a marriageprotection amendment most politicians are not going to want to stand up for the duty of standing in front of a steamroller  rice university political scientist bob stein talking to the houston chronicle about evangelicals and the marriage vote what perry did with the evangelicals was an organizational effort liberals tend to view those people as rabid dogs theyre not theyre sophisticated theyre organized church is just another organization  republican political consultant royal masset quoted in the austin americanstatesman on the vitriol in some political handouts on proposition 2 the gay marriage amendment when candidates are running against each other about 50 percent of the time they come to believe that their opponents are evil lying crooks but we consultants force them to smile and be positive with proposition campaigns you have no consultants who can control this display of bitterness  houston mayor bill white telling the houston chronicle he wont run for governor in 2006 the honorable thing to do is to do the job youve been hired for being mayor of this city is a fulltime job we have big plans for the next two years  frank parker of big spring a democrat and labor official telling the midland reportertelegram that people in politics have been swapping corporate for noncorporate contributions for years but that tom delay appears to have done it with bigger amounts of money thats why nobody stays in power for too long power corrupts but it also makes you stupid  austin attorney roy minton in that same story on travis county district attorney ronnie earle he is a loyal liberal democrat like me but he doesnt think like most lawyers he thinks more like a social studies professor  pat yezak elected to

Just Follow the Recipe	2005-10-24	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2005/10/24/just-follow-the-recipe/	en	somebody around here should point out the remarkable similarities between tom delays defense so far and kay bailey hutchisons defense against the same prosecutors in 1993 and 1994 hutchison won acquittal after a searing public investigation and indictments dropped indictments and reindictments that threatened her political career when the judge in that case john onion jr refused to preapprove evidence seized by prosecutors from hutchisons state treasury offices prosecutors refused to present their case with nothing from the prosecution to consider the court acquitted hutchison and heres the political moral shes been invincible in state politics since then so its no surprise that when faced with his own travis county troubles delay hired the same lawyer dick deguerin of houston and deguerin is using the same formula that ultimately ended with hutchisons acquittal on charges of using her state office and staff for political work theres been little in the way of a legal fight so far while there have been legal papers flying back and forth the courtroom wars are mostly still in front of us but the publicity wars are well under way and once indictments have been filed the spotlights and attention move from prosecutors to defenders and as he did a little over ten years ago deguerin took over the storytelling he started with a tale the prosecutors have woven  in this case that delay  co helped win the 2002 texas legislative elections with a vigorous injection of corporate money some of which they ran through the republican national committee to launder it for use in state elections where corporate funds are illegal and then he went to work building his own story  and with it his legal case  with a series of steps still being played out  attack the charges as an attempt to criminalize normal and even desirable political activity in hutchisons case the defense lawyers said its normal and traditional and honorable to communicate regularly with constituents and that some large number of the people interested in what an officeholder is doing are people who support those officeholders politically hutchison they argued was just doing her job delay theyre arguing now changed the face of texas politics by helping elect a gop majority in the statehouse which then helped change the political maps to create a republican majority in the states congressional delegation hes merely been an effective partisan and thats his job and besides they argue he wasnt involved in the sort of daytoday details and decisions alleged in the indictments  attack the prosecutor saying the investigation is a partisan affair and that the grand jury system has been abused last decade the volley at travis county district attorney ronnie earle was that hutchison had won a seat in the us senate that he himself wanted and that the prosecution was retribution and also an attempt to win favor with other democrats like governor ann richards earle they argued sought a greater award and they said the grand jury system used in travis county promoted cronyism with democratic judges picking supporters to serve who recommended friends in a cycle that produced a politically tainted system this time the shots at earle are similar the shots at the system are that earle abused it by shopping his charges to several grand juries before finding one that would report the current charges against delay  talk to the jury through the papers and television and other media so that when the real jury is chosen the pool will consist of people who know all about the case  whether theyve got it right or wrong  and people who avoid civics and legal and political stuff as if it were a big bowl of brussels sprouts this one is what defense lawyers do in all highprofile cases people are seeing the story on the news so you try to spin the story your own way its just like running a political campaign except that losers sometimes have to go to jail  ask for a change of venue on the basis of political bias of people in travis county and because theyve all read and heard so much about the inquiries into campaign finance that they cant possibly be objective hutchisons trial was moved from austin to fort worth deguerin asked for a change of venue in the delay trial this week what if the corporate franchise tax was replaced with an insurance premium  so that anybody paying the states business levy kept their liability protection and those who didnt pay lost it former comptroller john sharp whos heading governor rick perrys task force on taxes is tossing that idea around with business groups he says its not the work of the task force  the members of which havent been named yet  but just one of many ideas bumping around the idea starts with the seed of corporate privilege one of the arguments for the corporate franchise tax and the reason for its peculiar name is that the state grants companies the right to operate here in return for the tax those companies pay sharp is taking that a couple of ticks forward corporations and some other business organizations have limited liability  you cant go after the owners for more than their company is worth those sorts of businesses currently pay state taxes but other businesses organized as sole proprietorships or partnerships or whatever  dont pay the tax because of the way theyre formed forcing them to pay a business tax would be in effect forcing them to pay an unconstitutional state personal income tax sharps suggestion give businesses that pay the tax the limited liability protection enjoyed by corporations and deny it to those that dont he pitched the idea to the texas taxpayers and research association backpedaling as he laid it out to say its just an idea and hasnt risen to the level of a plan or a proposal  it would have the advantage at first blush of raising state money from businesses that dont pay taxes now maybe without tripping over the dreaded personal income tax and youll remember that when perry and sharp announced the formation of the task force both said personal income taxes will not be among the options under consideration the panel hasnt been put together yet sharp says itll likely have around a dozen members and that theyll be names you know  and he and others are working to staff the task force which will have the dual role of going around the state to put a plan together and then helping to sell that plan  or at least explain it  when the legislature is ready for a look that could come in the 2007 regular session or earlier if the courts order a solution to the states school finance system earlier than that state representative todd baxter raustin is calling supporters and others to tell them that he plans to resign from his hd48 seat to pursue job opportunities in the private sector baxter had been expected to seek reelection and had drawn three serious democratic opponents including attorney andy brown former eanes isd trustee donna howard and former austin isd trustee kathy rider baxter whod been a travis county commissioner was part of the big republican sophomore class that shifted control to the gop after redistricting he first won election to the house  against incumbent representative ann kitchen daustin  in 2002 and then prevailed in a very tight reelection battle in 2004 ben bentzin a republican who ran against senator gonzalo barrientos daustin in 2002 says hes seriously assessing the opportunity presented by baxters decision to retire bentzin lost to barrientos but tromped barrientos in the house district getting 56 percent of the votes he said he outperformed baxter in the house district by about three percentage points and would be trying to capitalize on those numbers if he ran for the house he says hell decide by the end of the week baxter in a written statement said hell resign as of november 1 to pursue professional and family goals  he didnt endorse anyone but said he expects the seat to remain in gop hands and i do not plan to be a casual observer in the upcoming elections  baxters resignation would presumably prompt a special election but its hard to say how fast that might happen when elizabeth ames jones rsan antonio left the

A Bailout Offer for Texas Democrats	2005-09-05	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2005/09/05/a-bailout-offer-for-texas-democrats/	en	a group that includes dallas lawyer fred baron  the chief fundraiser for the john kerryjohn edwards ticket last year  and marc stanley  the incoming president of the texas trial lawyers association  wants to reboot the texas democratic party infusing money and people to try to get that moribund organization running again baron says the party needs to build its voter files its idea development and its marketing to try to return the state to twoparty status as it stands the party is suffering from pecuniary strangulation  its broke  and candidates in the last couple of cycles tended to depend more on their own wits and the wits of their consultants than on the home base back in austin several local democratic groups around the state have been strong but most candidates dont rely on the state party for much we have as democrats a very strong message thats not being communicated very well baron says no democrat has won a statewide race in texas in ten years and none has held statewide office since january 1999 the party lost control of the texas legislature in 2002 and that new legislature redrew congressional districts to favor the gop which decisively took over the states delegation to washington in last years elections if this was a football team the coaches would all be saying its a rebuilding year and theres a lot of young talent and all that the boosters stick with us theres a payoff to this longwinded metaphor would be calling for the coaches heads and the fallback position would be to keep the head coach and fire all of the assistants so it is with the tdp chairman charles soechting isnt going anywhere for now  hes an elected official and isnt up for a rebid until next summer but baron and a group of consultants and financiers want to add six or seven fulltimers to the party staff in an effort baron says to build infrastructure the socalled lone star trust would add fulltime fundraisers an event planner a database expert a new executive director and press person to the staff of the party according to a couple of folks whove heard the pitch baron plans to unveil the whole plan on wednesday august 31 for members of the state democratic executive committee he wouldnt share specifics  saying he wants to show the party people first  but talked about problems the texas democrats have been having for one thing they cant raise enough money to remain effective barons group wants to put in seed money in an attempt to become an effective opposition party and to someday contend for control of state government if they can jumpstart the party he says texas democrats who give generously to other causes and to democrats out of state will return to funding the battles here baron says the group is not wed to any particular candidate or personalities and he says the states trial lawyers arent controlling it matt angle a longtime political advisor to former us representative martin frost of dallas has been organizing the effort and talking to other democrats about it for the last few months he didnt immediately return our calls but friends say hell return to his home and business in virginia as soon as this is either set up or rejected by democratic party leaders some democrats are quietly grousing about the idea calling it an attempt by trial lawyers to take over the machine and saying itll return the democrats to some of the things that made them unpopular with texas voters in the first place one change preceded barons pitch to the democrats and has been in the works for a while mike lavigne the partys executive director is leaving the tdp his replacement is ruben hernandez who worked with angle and others in frosts old organization for former us representative nick lampson dbeaumont and for a group called grassroots democrats hell start in october carole keeton strayhorn just a couple of days after hurricane katrina prompted her to suspend her political ads out of consideration for victims broke her selfimposed radio silence to open fire on governor rick perry while news reports were still focused on the devastation in the south strayhorn took time out to say perry isnt tough enough on sexual predators later in the day when he publicly signed legislation limiting governments ability to force property sales for economic development she fired another shot saying hed flipflopped after signing legislation removing obstacles for just such a deal in tarrant county her first complaint was that the states penalties for sex offenders are too light and that perry didnt push to strengthen them her second gripe was that perry signed legislation earlier this year that allowed a water district to use eminent domain to condemn property for economic development just the sort of thing that wouldnt be allowed under the new limits he signed two months later many of the questions that followed her prelunch announcement  that was the first one  concerned her promise to put politics aside while katrinas impact was fresh on that front she said shell waive penalties for outofstate taxpayers who because of the storm cant file on time democrat chris bell of houston went the other way suspending his online fundraising  which had an endofaugust deadline  and substituting a fundraising link for katrinas victims thousands of whom are seeking shelter in texas some in the astrodome some in reunion arena others wherever and perry  thisll sound cynical but isnt meant to be  was shining in the aftermath of the storm public emergencies mark a high point in a governors powers and ability to help and perry and his staff responded by pulling all the stops he announced the opening of the astrodome to victims cited a federal law that requires states to educate the homeless and then defined the displaced from louisiana as homeless letting their kids into texas schools he ordered emergency crews and other resources into stormwracked areas theyre suspending trucking regulations to get supplies into the area sending emergency gasoline to florida on the far edge of the storm and so on public disasters make for a lousy political environment with an exception they can elevate officeholders who are in a position to actually provide help or leadership when its needed former new york mayor rudy giuliani is one famous case within that framework the advantage right now is perrys and most of the candidates are laying low finding a state leader who thinks itll take a court order to solve school finance isnt hard  try house speaker tom craddicks office and its not because they want the courts to tell them what to do its because they need the courts to narrow the question  to tell them what doesnt need repair its a familiar problem to college sophomores taking introductory philosophy classes first define the question and the terms of the argument almost a year ago state district judge john dietz of austin decided the current system violates the states constitution he said the funding system doesnt allow districts enough money to meet the standards set by the state and prevents them from providing texas kids with adequate educations and he ruled that the states 150 cap on property tax rates has become in effect an illegal state property tax since most districts dont have any meaningful choice in charging taxpayers a lower rate the state appealed and everyone is looking now to the state supreme court for a final ruling on those points but governor rick perry and the legislature kept trying to work out the problem while the courts were hearing the challenges to the current system they were trying to agree on a solution before the court finished its legal diagnosis of the malady and like their lawmaking predecessors before them they were stumped its easy to reach a political solution to school finance just make about 1100 school districts happy at the same time unless you can give each district more money in a new system than it already gets thats impossible but lawmakers didnt stop at that conundrum they simultaneously tackled another dangerous puzzle by attempting to raise state taxes to buy down local school taxes to raise taxes you seek a plan with more winners than losers one reason they cant find the answer is that they cant agree on what questions to ask state leaders and the lawmakers looking to them for guidance had at least a halfdozen different and often competing goals in no particular order  reform schools to make them more accountable for the money they get and to make sure as much of it as possible is used to educate kids as opposed to feeding them busing them herding them counting them etc governor perry followed the session by ordering part of this saying districts ought to be using at least twothirds of their money for classroom education by 2009  lower local school property taxes and cap increases in property values to take pressure off home and other property owners  give teachers and other school employees a pay raise to bring salaries closer to the national average and to try to attract and retain the best people in education  limit how much locally raised property tax money in wealthy districts has to be shared with poorer districts  increase the states share of the public education bill to 60 percent or more from its current level around 40 percent a goal that was pursued with only temporary success by state leaders like george w bush and ann richards in the 1990s  increase education spending to try to bring up student achievement pulling more schools up to standards set by the state  lower the number of districts where  in spite of sharethewealth formulas  property wealth still means higher spending per pupil than is possible elsewhere in the state and there were several other issues loosely assembled under the umbrella of school reform that some hold dear start school after labor day and do away with some of the holidays that poke holes in the annual school calendar move school board elections to november which probably would make them more partisan and probably would increase voter turnout put more technology into schools as part of what some gearheads hope will spell an end to 30pound backpacks and a beginning to students lugging computers that contain textbooks and other education software talk to five legislators and you can probably add to the list a court decision  with a narrow enough definition of just whats broken and must be fixed  would be handy right now and the legislature is apparently ready to wait for the court to do what its leaders couldnt do say what needs repair and what can be left for later while they wait for that final unassailable court order  which could come any time  nervous state lawmakers are steeling themselves for the 2006 elections state representative bob griggs rnorth richland hills has decided to pack it in after all he put off retirement plans to run in the first place and has been openly talking about hanging up his running shoes after the current term now hes announced it the former school superintendent who irked some republicans with his independence from management on education and other issues will serve out this term in hd91 and leave pat carlson who chairs the tarrant county gop has already said shell run she and her husband are building a new house in the district they live outside the district now add two more to the mix kelly hancock a trustee in birdville isd and charles scoma the former mayor of north richland hills both are republicans its remarkably red territory no democrat won that district at the state or county level in the 2002 elections and state representative suzanna gratia hupp rlampasas says she wont run for reelection in hd54 at the end of this term shes not ruling out future public service but said in a written announcement shell continue to serve the public interest in a private capacity  she also said she hopes shell get a shot at solving school finance before her current term ends alluding to a possible special session after the texas supreme court rules hupp is skipping out two years before her retirement improves lawmakers vest in their retirement after eight years in office and can start drawing checks when theyre 60 years old if they serve 12 years the checks start coming when theyre 50 years old hupp will have served 10 years in the house at the end of this term hd54 is gop turf all but one of the statewide republicans  attorney general greg abbott  did slightly better in the district than they did overall in 2002 two houston republicans  representatives peggy hamric and joe nixon  are giving up their reelection chances to seek promotion tot he senate the two will be in a gop primary along with city councilman mark ellis and maybe ben streusand who lost a congressional race last year to replace senator jon lindsay rhouston who is retiring after this term representative terry keel raustin is leaving the house to run for the 3rd court of appeals in austin representative richard raymond dlaredo is plotting a challenge to us representative henry cuellar dlaredo former state and us representative ciro rodriguez dsan antonio is also in the hunt for that spot which he lost to cuellar two

have an opponent last year olivo won her 2002 reelection with 63 percent of the votes over mark rubal in 2000 she beat republican lester phipps in the general election getting 64 percent of the votes after smothering samuel gonzalez in the democratic primary where olivo collected 88 percent of the votes its a safely democratic district if you look at the results of statewide races although the congressional district with the biggest overlap belongs to us house majority leader tom delay rsugar land he squeaked in olivo territory by six votes on his way to an overall 64 percent win in 2002 the best performance by a statewide republican candidate came in the comptrollers race where carole keeton strayhorn last name rylander at that time beat democrat marty akins by 110 votes on her way to a statewide win senator ken armbrister dvictoria  whose district partly overlaps the house district  lost in his section of hd27 to phipps who moved up the ballot in 2002 though he lost in the district armbrister handily beat phipps elsewhere blacks and hispanics together make up about 65 percent of the district according to the 2000 census brown is africanamerican olivo is hispanic brown worked for several houston democrats including us representative sheila jackson lee senator rodney ellis and representative sylvester turner before signing on with the texas medical association as a lobbyist hes now with the american heart association and plans to stay with that organization as he moves from austin to the district to run against olivo brown says he is aware of rumors that former representative ron wilson dhouston and house speaker tom craddick rmidland are trying to recruit friendly democrats to run against unfriendly ones but says he hasnt talked to either of them and says people in the district urged him into the race he says hell push economic development and education craddick meanwhile says through an aide that those rumors are false hes not working against any incumbent house members  republican or democrat  and doesnt plan to do so says alexis delee his spokeswoman texas land commissioner jerry patterson dispatched his agencys oil spill team to new orleans along with seven boats ten trucks a bird rehabilitation trailer a mobile command post cash advances its hard to cash a check out there right now and permission to carry pistols and rifles patterson

a good idea its dangerous out there patterson says guns aside its the first time the oil spillers have been sent out of state in anything beyond advisory roles he says  molly beth malcolm the former chairwoman of the texas democratic party and so far the only female to hold that job endorsed chris bells run for governor lauding the former congressman from houston for his official ethics

Brother Can You Spare A Dime? A Quarter?	2005-06-13	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2005/06/13/brother-can-you-spare-a-dime-a-quarter/	en	looking for a newspaper clip on the internet the other day we stumbled on what appeared to be the story we sought it was about governor rick perry telling a tyler audience about the prospects for a special session of the legislature but instead of what we expected  an account of perrys efforts to negotiate a deal the house and senate could swallow  it said perry had given up trying to solve school finance until legislative leaders had a viable plan then we noticed we had the right paper the right people the right issue and the wrong year when we quit the 2004 story and found the 2005 story it had perry predicting a special session by the end of this month after he brought lieutenant governor david dewhurst and house speaker tom craddick together for the sort of deal that has eluded all three men for the last two years perry has met with both dewhurst and craddick several senators apparently at the behest of perry  who badly needs a school finance bill  and dewhurst  who badly wants one  have been calling house members to see whether theyre anxious to come back to austin the theory apparently is that legislators confronted by angry constituents will want to come back to austin to finish the job perrys shuttle diplomacy is an attempt to have dewhurst and craddick on board if legislators call in and beg for a special session one proposal that is under discussion but to which no fingerprints adhere would start with the 2 billion to 25 billion thats in the state treasury but which went unspent when school finance fell apart add to that the roughly 1 billion that a 1 additional tax on cigarettes would produce if lawmakers can close the two biggest loopholes in the state franchise tax  one is the delaware sub and one is called the geoffreys loophole  theyd get another 750 million to 800 million thats enough money to get a 25cent cut in local school property taxes and to cover other spending that tax cut would trigger the school finance system is a tricky thing and that might be enough to buy political cover for perry and anyone else whos in trouble because of what the lege didnt do during the first five months of the year timing is a problem if not for the schools then for the politicians a quick fix on school finance might put changes in place in time for the school districts to figure new budgets but it wouldnt deliver goodies to taxpayers before next years primary elections it takes a while for a property tax cut to wend its way through school budgets tax authorities mortgage escrow accounts and the like that was one reason lawmakers tried to solve this mess in a special session a year ago a solution then would have produced results  and presumably happy taxpayers and voters  in time for the march 2006 elections before the spin machine goes to work heres what us senator kay bailey hutchison had to say about running for governor she talked to a gaggle of reporters after speaking at the investiture of priscilla owen spot the talking points in this bit of monologue from hutchison unfiltered certainly i am in the home stretch of making the decision for whats right for texas as you know i tried to stay out of the fray during the legislative session because there are so many important issues facing the legislature i am disappointed like everyone that school finance and especially relief for the property taxpayers of our state were not addressed i do hope that the governor chooses to call a special session now in the budget there is an allocation for teacher pay raises for judge pay raises for the buying of textbooks on time and i think its time that we have that session to do whats right in the budget and i dont think our teachers should start in the fall not having the pay raises that we meant for them to have so it is my hope that this is not over and i certainly would like to withhold anything further until the legislature has the chance to come back and address these issues we should take the schools out of the courts and put it back in the hands of elected officials and the people of this state ive tried to stay out of the political fray you will notice that during the whole regular session that ive tried to stay out of the way so that school finance giving teacher pay raises giving property tax relief to the people of texas would be addressed by the legislature i know the legislature tried to do it i think we need leadership to be shown now more than ever to do what is right for our state texas is the greatest state in america i want us to be the example of how to do things right i want other states to look to us to be the state that has the creativity and the innovation to do whats right to keep our state the best thats my goal and i hope that is what is shown by all of our elected leaders in the future i think thats probably about all i need to say today  that bit prompted a couple of political reporters of our acquaintance to adjust their positions on the betting pool on whether shell run parse it like a scribbler she set up the logic for a race put the leadership baby on the governors doorstep and said a session should be called to get raises for judges and teachers property tax cuts textbooks and school finance representative kent grusendorf rarlington put out a statement after hearing hutchisons remarks saying hes ready to call hearings of the house public education committee he chairs it on any plan she offers as govs bush clements and richards all learned before there is nothing as complicated complex or challenging as school finance  thats what hutchison might have said had she come to town to help rick perry become the first tenyear governor of texas a spokesman for perry said the guv also wants lawmakers to come back and also doesnt think theyve done their jobs on school finance from robert black the fact of the matter is the governor believes they havent finished their work  the federal judges who okayed the current congressional maps in texas have on reconsideration approved them again their opinion can be downloaded at wwwtexasweeklycomdocuments20050609redistrictingpdf texas attorney general greg abbott in a statement said the ruling should end the matter and it is time to move on  nina perales a san antonio lawyer who represents the gi forum said she is still digesting the opinion but said her clients are as unhappy with this now as they were in 2003 when the court first ruled officially the lawyers on the losing side are still talking to their clients and reading the opinion and all that unofficially they plan to appeal cases like this go straight from the threejudge trial court to the us supreme court and that would be the next stop on the appeal express a quick history in case you havent been thinking about redistricting in your spare time several different groups sued to stop the state from putting new congressional maps in place including texas democrats congressional democrats the gi forum and the texas naacp they had different angles variously arguing that the maps were overly and unconstitutionally partisan that they were drawn to minimize the voting power of minorities and broadly speaking that the new maps removed some texans a reasonable chance to elect candidates of their choice to the us house three federal judges were impaneled to hear the case they ruled in the states favor saying the new congressional maps are legal the plaintiffs appealed to the supremes who had been working on a different redistricting case from pennsylvania instead of ruling on the texas maps the high court sent the case back to the threejudge panel and told them to view it through the filter of the supreme courts ruling in the pennsylvania case this bit is about that ruling the pennsylvania case  styled vieth vs jubelirer  was based on the idea that partisan gerrymandering had resulted in an unfair map that disenfranchised some voters the supremes decided that wasnt the case but the justices werent in agreement on several points one point in particular is tantalizing to redistricting lawyers and political geeks the court left open the idea that there might be a line to be drawn between fair and unfair partisanship in the design of political districts in this newest opinion the texas judges patrick higginbotham of dallas who is on the 5th us circuit court of appeals and trial judges lee rosenthal of houston and t john ward of marshall say they were right about the partisan mapping the first time that doesnt solve the puzzle about how much partisanship is too much partisanship but without direction about whats in and whats out of bounds the texas judges decided the maps are fair we conclude that claims of excessive partisanship before us suffer from a lack of any measure of substantive fairness they wrote the court did say the noncompetitive districts on the new map that some see as a stain arent all that unusual the argument ignores a historical fact the texas delegation has enjoyed noncompetitive districts for at least the past four and a half decades long before there were two political parties of any strength in the state the judges wrote they agreed with the states argument that the new maps produced a big swing from the democrats to the republicans because the old map was unfair and the new map was a truer reflection of the voting strength of the two parties they limited the new opinion to that question about partisan gerrymandering if the case goes up the food chain other issues will be open just as they would have been had the supremes heard the original appeal one of those  whether middecade redistricting violates constitutional standards of one man one vote  got the texas judges attention though they didnt rule on it since they were concerned mainly with the vieth case but they did go on about it redistricting is required every ten years when the census comes out lawmakers are required to draw districts that have the same number of people in them  thats one man one vote but a middecade like the one in texas is done with numbers from the beginning of the decade and ignores population changes that took place in the meantime the argument is that the middecade maps violate the constitutional rule because they use out of date census numbers and since there arent any better numbers the defendants contend middecade redistricting is unconstitutional in a concurring opinion ward suggested a statewide census that would form the basis for middecade maps and said hed have tossed the congressional maps on that basis if he and the other judges werent limited to the political gerrymandering arguments from pennsylvania four years and a month after president george w bush nominated priscilla owen for a spot on the 5th us circuit court of appeals she took the oath of office owen was sworn in during a closed ceremony in the texas supreme court chambers surrounded by family current and former members of the states high court and other courts and a mess of law clerks court staff and news reporters owen is one of a handful of judges whose confirmations stalled during partisan warfare in the us senate democrats said she and the others were so conservative as to be unsuitable for the courts republicans said they all deserved up or down votes from the gopdominated senate a deal that headed off an impasse over filibusters also gave owen a vote and she won confirmation at the swearing owen sat between us senator kay bailey hutchison and governor rick perry all three spoke briefly as did chief justice wallace jefferson justice nathan hecht and judge carolyn dineen king the chief judge on the new orleansbased court and in that owens new boss owen took the oath from hecht while her mother held sam houstons bible for the newest federal judge from texas governor perry will get another appointment to the court naming a justice to replace owen he appointed all but three of the courts current justices several have since won election and five  including owens replacement  will be on the ballot next year you were looking for closure maybe comptroller carole keeton strayhorn announced only days after the legislative session was over that the amount of money available exceeds the amount lawmakers spent in their 1394 billion budget the corresponding number from two years ago 1174 billion thats a 22 billion increase but its a balanced budget thats good news for lawmakers but it came with an asterisk she hasnt yet tallied a second piece of spending legislation  the socalled supplemental appropriations bill that measure hb 10 includes appropriations for the current budget year and for the next twoyear budget cycle the current money covers spending that wasnt anticipated two years ago when the current budget was written the other stuff was lumped together in the last weeks of the session as budgeteers juggled several spending and revenue bills whether the whole package balances wont be completely clear until strayhorn certifies the supplemental bill and she tossed out a cautionary note saying shell watch the governors lineitem vetoes to make sure he doesnt cut something that would actually bring in more revenue thus throwing the numbers out of whack if it balances no problem if it doesnt some of the bigger state agencies  health and human services departments for instance  could find themselves without the money to finish the year strayhorn caused a fuss two years ago when she said lawmakers had budgeted more spending than the state could afford they pointed to a nobounce provision in the budget that automatically trimmed spending if money fell short she said then and says now that that was unconstitutional that provision  strayhorn calls it a get out of jail free card  has never been tested in court neither has the legislatures contention that strayhorn has to certify the budget within a certain amount of time some lawmakers say she must finish her work during the 20 days after the session a period that coincides with the governors deadline for vetoes but thats not written down anywhere in law and strayhorn says its baloney even so she finished certification on the bigger of the two budget bills in record time david sibley jr is mulling a run for a waco seat in the texas house thats a good ballot name up there hes the son of former state senator david sibley rwaco a law student at baylor and a republican

Lifestyles of the Corrupt and Elected - The Texas Observer	2011-01-16	TEXAS OBSERVER	http://www.texasobserver.org/lifestyles-of-the-corrupt-and-elected/	en	troy fraser enjoys the kind of job security most americans can only dream of hes served in the texas senate for 14 years and wont likely lose an election any time soon the 61yearold republican from the conservative central texas resort area horseshoe bay hasnt even faced a democratic opponent since 1996 hes run unopposed twice his worst showing in the past decade came in 2008 when he was challenged by a libertarian party candidate and eked out a victory with a mere 85 percent of the vote barring a major scandal fraser can serve in the state senate as long as he wants yet fraser has amassed one of the largest campaign funds in the legislature nearly 13 million nearly all of the money hes raised in the past two yearsabout 97 percentwas contributed by special interests according to a recent analysis by austins kxan in the last two years the finance insurance and real estate industries combined gave fraser a quarter of his total campaign donations you might wonder what fraser with no competitive election in sight is doing with all this campaign money hes living off it fraser like all texas legislators is allowed to use campaign money to augment his lifestyle to rent a condo take his family on opulent trips and stay in exclusive hotels and resorts since he was last elected in 2008 fraser has spent more than 388000 in campaign funds most of it unrelated to any election fraser tapped campaign money to help pay for a trip with his wife to park city utah during ski season he and his wife also used the money to travel to hawaii san francisco and monterey calif england spain russia germany puerto rico panama and costa rica where they stayed at a 400anight resort nestled among some waterfalls under texas law he could legally use campaign money to pay for these trips as long as they could be somehow connected to state business watch a video from the luxury springs resort where state senator troy fraser stayed in costa rica fraser also used campaign funds to pay dry cleaning bills according to state records an apparent violation of texas election law fraser like other lawmakers is using his campaign account like a 13 million personal expense fund that corporate political action committees are constantly refilling with money frasers spending has been extravagant but not unique the observer analyzed five years of campaign data filed with the texas ethics commission by all texas officeholders we combed through 670000 expenditures by hundreds of elected officials its difficult to determine how much money legislators are spending on noncampaign expenses many outlays arent labeled and many others carry vague descriptions that make it nearly impossible to distinguish a legitimate campaign expense from a personal expenditure but the observer investigation uncovered a handful of legislators who likely violated texas law fraser and three others paid personal expenses such as dry cleaning from their campaign accounts which is expressly forbidden and while many other expenses are likely legal the observer analysis found that legislators use campaign money collected from special interests to pay for luxurious lifestyles attorney gen greg abbott used campaign funds to pay off cell phone bills which averaged 600 a month state senator craig estes a republican from wichita falls rented a 3000amonth condo in a swank downtown austin highrise senator dan patrick a houston republican dropped almost 600 to decorate his office with stuffed animal heads senator jane nelson rlewisville took her husband to hawaii her senate colleagues john whitmire dhouston and mario gallegos jr dhouston traveled to the aloha state too senator florence shapiro rplano used campaign money to pay for a 1200 stay at the oceanside el conquistador resort and golden door spa in puerto rico shapiros office noted that she was attending the council of state governments conference which was held at the resort no elected official has spent more on travel since 2005 than governor rick perry whose campaign reported 442000 in travel outlays much of it out of state the high cost stems from perry and his staffs affinity for traveling on private jets major campaign donors have flown the governor and his staff all over the country these trips listed as inkind donations to perrys campaign cost up to 10000 per flight some of these donors werent flying perry around simply out of generosity on at least two occasions when they reached their destination perry and his staff advocated for policies that would benefit the donor that flew them there this is hugely broad says craig mcdonald of texans for public justice you can take money from a special interest whos lobbying on a bill near and dear to their heart and you can take six friends to the super bowl with the money it so often crosses the line into supplementing a legislators lifestyle  for decades texas law has permitted legislators to spend money from their campaign accounts to offset expenses they incur from holding elected office texas legislators are paid only 7200 a year among the lowest legislative salaries in the country their 168 per diem one of the highest in the country is meant to help defray the costs of coming to austin and living in the city during session but their campaign accounts often end up covering many of those expenses that includes paying for apartments and cars in austin trips to policy conferences and just about any expense they can ostensibly relate to legislative business limitations are few legislators cant tap campaign cash for personal spending they cant use campaign money to buy property beyond that the ethics commission has used a narrow definition of personal expenses the agency has deemed it legal for lawmakers to use campaign funds to pay for their cell phones while these rules have been in place since 1991 government watchdogs say the system has grown unseemly in recent years with many legislators ensconced in safe districts and assured of reelection and with more and more specialinterest money at their disposal politicians can freely treat themselves to extravagant lifestyles paid for by corporate pacs its a system that sometimes amounts to legalized corruption there needs to be some stricter regulations mcdonald says yeah the law allows you to buy a lexus but should you maybe only be allowed to buy a prius i dont know but i think there have to be some guidelines on what is allowable and what isnt beyond this broad category of anything but personal use for instance senator frasers trips were ostensibly related to state business so it was legal for him to use campaign money to take his wife linda to some of the worlds most popular tourist destinations in april 2010 fraser and his wife visited costa rica for a tour of wind farms as he later wrote on his state disclosure filings a trip to costa rica may seem a tenuous business expense at best but it was related to frasers work in the state senate hes long been involved in state windenergy policy and he chairs the senate committee on natural resources asked about the trip fraser told the observer he traveled through costa rica on his way to panama he said the new panamanian president ricardo martinelli invited the senator to discuss how the country could boost its renewable energy output and emulate texas which is the worlds thirdlargest producer of wind energy and costa rica which generates more than 90 percent of its power from renewable sources but the trip also included some nice perks on april 21 2010 the frasers treated themselves to two nights at the springs resort and spa a stunning hotel ringed in waterfalls with panoramic views of surrounding volcanoes even the cheapest rooms run 400 a night during peak season fraser paid the 562 bill out of his campaign funds fraser defends the expenditure he says that the hotel was near two wind farms he planned to study and that those were the only two nights during his weeklong stay in costa rica that he charged to his campaign account and he says it wasnt that pricey their normal rate was expensive but i got a good deal  true enough frasers bill averaged out to 280 a night which is much less than the hotels listed rates still for two nights the senator and his wife enjoyed a stay at one of the most desirable hotels in costa rica courtesy of the texas business lobby ironically it might be frasers smaller expenses that land him in trouble the texas ethics commissions rules on using campaign accounts are broad but they do forbid politicians from using the money for a few specific expenses including dry cleaning last january the ethics commission fined state representative phil king 1300 in part for spending his campaign funds on dry cleaning bills twice during the 2009 session fraser sent his dirty laundry to cathys cleanersthe transgression king made i had to get suits cleaned for use during session fraser says i dont wear suits any other time you know that im retired i dont have a job that i wear a suit to in my district because its a rural district i dont wear a suit  fraser wasnt the only one state representative fred brown preferred tip top cleaners where he took his clothes in august 2009 in 2007 senator mike jackson sent his suits out to american cleaners 8 and back in 2005 rick hardcastle was a frequent customer at jack brown cleaners taking his clothes in 10 times during the legislative session all four lawmakers appear to be in violation of the ethics commissions 1992 decision that legislators may not use political contributions to pay laundry and dry cleaning expenses incurred in austin  when told the ethics commission had specifically prohibited using campaign money to pay for dry cleaning fraser said youre telling me something i dont know obviously this isnt a huge amount of money to me i was not aware there was any concern about it never heard that one before  good muckraking he added the rules governing travel arent as clearly spelled out for instance conferences no matter how farflung or farfetched are generally safe as are trips related to either public policy or a political race but sometimes the trips arent quite so easily connected to state or election business houston democratic senator john whitmire spent 504 in june to stay at a california inn and attend a district legislative weddingcelebrating the nuptials of representative ana hernandez a democrat who lives in his district three times between 2008 and 2010 senator shapiro flew to washington dc for holocaust museum board meetings she used her campaign account to pay for a total of 2100 the museum is funded through federal and private dollars and sits 1300 miles from shapiros district shapiros office justified the expenditure saying in a statement that as an elected official senator florence shapiro has been a national leader in the jewish community because of her leadership she was appointed by president george w bush to be on the board of the us holocaust memorial museum and these trips were to attend board meetings in her official capacity  aerial view of el congquistador resort  golden spa in puerto rico where senator florence shapiro stayed with campaign money photo courtesy of el conquistador resort  while the ethics commission rarely fines officials for their trips in 2009 it levied the largest fine on record to harris county commissioner jerry eversole for using his campaign funds for personal costs as the houston chronicle reported at the time among the more egregious examples according to the ethics commission was a 10000 trip to florida he took with his wife and two friends paid for out of his officeholder account  the more legally ambiguous expenditures are often the smallest for instance san antonio senator leticia van de putte a democrat bought 268 in wedding gifts at bed bath  beyond not to be outdone whitmire dropped 349 at the same store for a constituent gift  back in 2006 senator dan patrick a houston republican used his account to spend 134 on clothes at mens wearhousefor photo shoot his filing explains and with almost no explanation senator judith zaffirini a laredo democrat has spent almost 2000 at amazoncom noting only that the money was for books  normally legal trouble only comes to elected officials if a texas resident actually files a complaint from there the ethics commission investigates and penalties come in the form of fines the fines often occur when expenditure reports are sloppily filed or contain technical errors when representative rene oliveira dbrownsville got in trouble for a variety of errors ranging from alleged personal use violations like dry cleaning and grocery shopping to reporting errors the ethics commission slapped him with a 3000 fine for the technical problems but found insufficient evidence to punish him for personal use while small expenditures might get lawmakers fined its the larger outlayssuch as flying around the country on private jets belonging to major campaign donorsthat can be more ethically troubling on oct 5 2009 governor perry and three aides boarded a private jet in austin and flew to biloxi mississippi the jet belonged to toby neugebauer an oil and gas investor as required by law perrys campaign would report the 6250 plane flight from neugebauer as an inkind campaign contribution neugebauer and his wife have long supported perry donating more than 110000 to him according to texans for public justice neugebauer may have been supporting perry because he liked his ideological bent but he also has a financial interest in backing the governor neugebauer is a managing partner at quantum energy partners a houston private equity firm that has invested millions in energy production in texas the firm invested heavily in the controversial natural gas drilling in north texas barnett shale formation the texas commission on environmental qualitythe states regulatory agency whose leaders perry appointsregulates drilling in the barnett shale when they boarded neugebauers jet last october perry and his aides were traveling to biloxi for a meeting of the interstate oil and gas compact commission a governmental body made up of officials from energyproducing states the commission advises states on energy production and regulatory policies perry addressed the commission as its incoming chairman for 2010the first texas governor to lead the commission since mark white in 1985 in his speech perry emphasized the need for oil and natural gas production i believe that anyone disc ssing energy in ou nation and world must begin by acknowledging the essential role that oil and gas have played throughout our history and the reality that they must continue as fundamental elements of our energy portfolio perry said according to oil and gas journal an industry publication the flight to biloxi was one of at least 31 flights that perry members of his family or his employees have taken on the private jets of major donors in the past five years on one occasion in september 2007 james leininger the san antonio schoolvoucher advocate flew perrys son griffin to florida so he could attend events with the governor on at least three other trips major donors flew perry stafferspublic employeesto events that involved substantive policy discussions or state business in november 2006 perrys thenspeechwriter eric bearse flew from austin to miami and then to mexico city to attend the inauguration of felipe calderon on private jets paid for by charles tate an investor whos given the governor nearly 400000 and by megadeveloper bob perry the governors most prolific individual donor in december 2008 the houston billionaire businessman thomas friedkin flew perrys deputy chief of staff kris heckmann to philadelphia on his private plane to meet with presidentelect obama then theres the july 2008 flights on which perry and five staffers flew to washington and back to meet with environmental protection agency officials they got there on a private plane paid for by chicken magnate lonnie bo pilgrim the flights cost roughly 18000 roundtrip pilgrim flew perry and staff to dc because he wanted the governor to lobby the epa to lower federal quotas on ethanol production the details of this trip were first reported by the houston chronicle pilgrim and others contended that too much ethanol production was raising corn prices and damaging his poultry business perry brought along his policy team his senior advisor mike morrissey general counsel david cabrales and energy policy aide toby baker they met with highlevel epa administrators but their arguments apparently werent compelling the bush administration rejected perrys request and pilgrims poultry business filed for bankruptcy later that year asked why perrys office relies so heavily on private planes katherine cesinger the offices deputy press secretary emailed back the governor normally pays for air travel with nonstate funds in an effort to minimize the cost to texas taxpayers  the governors office didnt respond to a followup question about whether the governor and his staff risk conflicts of interest by using private travel sponsored by major donors who have a financial stake in their policy discussions of course a variety of legitimate costs come with being a state lawmaker like having a place to stay in austin and traveling back and forth from home for that the states 168 per diem is designed to pay for the higher costs of living that come with holding office but for many lawmakers those daily checks dont cover their lifestyles take senator craig estes who managed to find one of the most expensive condos in austin with the exception of two months estes paid at least 3000 a month in rent between january 2007 and june 2010 the condo in the upscale westgate tower across from the capitol has three bedrooms and three bathrooms and it was recently listed at 749000 estes was well on his way to a down payment in total he spent around 130000 on the luxury condo much of the time he was paying rent the legislature wasnt in session in all estes reported spending a whopping 106000 out of his campaign account in just the first six months of 2010 even though he wasnt on the ballot he last stood for reelection in 2008 when he ran unopposed in the two years since then estes has spent 347000 from his campaign account i agree that austin is a very expensive city to live in especially in close proximity to the capitol estes wrote in a statement its been very convenient to live across the street from the capitol but i am moving further away to save on campaign expenses  estes noted that his expenses were clearly covered under the texas election code when lawmakers have to leave home or their austin homeawayfromhome many find new ways to live in luxury when the american bar association met in beverly hills in 2008 senator jeff wentworth flew out and stayed at the extremely upscale beverly wilshire hotel on rodeo drivethe same hotel featured in the film pretty woman following in the steps of julia roberts isnt cheap his campaign footed a 1810 bill for the stay thats just one of many fancy hotel stays wentworth has enjoyed since 2006 hes charged his campaign for 20 such trips to policy conferences going as far away as fajardo puerto rico and totalling almost 24000 these stays are likely legal under state ethics laws because they connect to wentworths position as a senator representing his district representative beverly woolley certainly got to see the sights when she went on a trade mission from texas to qatar paid for out of her campaign account after using her 1425 tickets on qatar airways she checked into the al watani sharq village and spa dropping 500 at the resort then she headed to the citys hyatt regency where her campaign footed a 1442 bill the trip was ostensibly a trade mission in which woolley accompanied thensecretary of state phil wilson to help strengthen bonds between texas and the persian gulf nation but when it comes to overseas travel senator rodney ellis dhouston might be the state senator most eager to spread his wings since 2006 hes gone to china belize ghana france and belgium the reasons varyhis trips to france and china were trade missions and he went to belgium and belize to attend conferences his trip to ghana is more mysterious observorassembly of african union he listed as the purpose for his trip and participate in the opening diaspora center in accra  ellis justified the trip in a statement over the years developing international relationships has become increasingly integral to improving my ability to effectively serve my district and the state of texas he wrote one out of every three jobs in houston is directly related to foreign trade my district and the city of houston is an epicenter for international trade economic relations and includes numerous nationalities  of his trip to accra he said i did my best to represent my district and the state of texas by meeting with most of the african heads of state who attended  one lobbyist interviewed for this storywho didnt want to be quoted by name discussing lawmakers spending habitscontended that legislators often were justified in paying for policy conferences and other official business out of campaign accounts if they use campaign funds lawmakers must disclose the spending if an outside interest pays their way the public may never know about it the only other options would be to charge the state or pay for it themselves a member paying for this personallywhen theyre doing this on staterelated businessi dont think thats proper fraser said i dont want the state paying for it in most circumstances with a foreign country i dont want them paying for it so the one that is left is the officeholder account that is the accepted way of doing this members have done this for a long time that is probably the most desirable way  travel expenses are only a fraction of the payouts there are also cell phones undoubtedly many lawmakers use their phones for state and campaign business a legally acceptable place to spend their campaign dollars but some use their phones a lot between 2006 and 2010 attorney gen greg abbott reported 33000 in cell phone billsaveraging almost 600 a month senator eddie lucio jr dbrownsville wasnt far behind with his 24000 in bills and lucio didnt settle for just any phone when the iphone 4 came out in june he promptly dropped 430 on an upgrade for apples latest device lucios not the only lawmaker with a preference for apple products this past summer wentworth along with his colleagues dan patrick and representative wayne christian rcenter all became owners of the trendy new ipad wentworth and patrick limited themselves to the machines spending 1000 and 772 respectively christian however kept an eye out for all the bells and whistles among other accessories for what he filed as his campaign ipad a 43 combocharger a 75 keyboard dock 72 for a car charger adapter and microphone and 36 worth of screen savers some lawmakers take a more narrow view of their expense accounts when former lieutenant governor bill ratliff served in the state senate he didnt find himself on lavish vacations honestly i didnt do any of this traveling he says i went to one education conference in new orleans  he says he rarely dipped into his campaign account outside of keeping an apartment in austin not that he didnt have unexpected costs ratliff remembers specifically his small dog we had to kennel that dog when we came to session he said explaining that he just paid the expenses out of pocket it cost me money in order to serve  still he never considered using campaign dollars to cover the cost instead just relying on his personal money and state salary i just felt like that was part of what my salary was for

                          Once illegal, Houston legislator works to change perceptions         	2011-05-30	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://www.chron.com//news/houston-texas/article/Once-illegal-Houston-legislator-works-to-change-1623518.php	en	state representative ana hernandez luna stood before the house on the afternoon of may 9 hours after lawmakers passed the controversial sanctuary city bill and started reading from a prepared statement her eyes downcast i know house bill 12 already passed and in the long run there is nothing that could have been done about its passage she said but still she said she had something to say and then in a halting and teary speech hernandez luna dhouston described what life is like as an illegal immigrant she knows she said because she lived it immigration and all that it encompasses is very personal for me because i was an undocumented immigrant hernandez luna said you may prefer to use the word illegal alien but im not an alien i am not a problem that must be handled im a human  a person standing before you now as a representative for the texas house  with her roughly fiveminute speech the 32yearold lawyer and lawmaker did what some would consider crazy in the current political climate she tried to put a human face  her own face  on the illegal immigration issue i believe they have a perception of what an undocumented immigrant should be and i dont fit in that she said in a recent interview and thats why i felt it was important to share my story and put a face on the issue and let people know were not just talking about criminals here who need to be deported  her story of assimilation was called remarkable even by hawkish illegal immigration foes who have a firm hold on the house and overwhelmingly passed hb12 the sanctuary cities bill which ultimately failed to make it through the senate would have made it illegal to prohibit state and local law enforcement from enforcing federal immigration laws some of her colleagues across the aisle the targeted audience for her speech were unmoved  at least from a policy perspective shes a real sweet gal said state representative debbie riddle rtomball i admire the difficulties that she has overcome but i still stand strong that we have got to protect our borders we need to enforce our laws  for every good story theres a bad story riddle said there are a lot of people who are frustrated with rewarding those who come over here illegally and essentially penalizing those who abide by the laws  hernandez luna said her parents packed up a single suitcase and brought her to houston from reynosa mexico as an infant along with her 4yearold sister they shared a brick duplex on alamo street just outside downtown houston with her fathers cousin they overstayed their visitors visas and lived undocumented for eight years her parents paid taxes she said and bought a house in houston within about five years she remembers fearing as a little girl that her mother would be picked up by immigration agents staking out the local fiesta grocery store or that her father would not come home after one of his overnight warehouse shifts celia fleischman principal at gardens elementary school in pasadena said she remembered hernandez luna struggling with her english but quickly catching on her mother worked in the school cafeteria and hernandez luna would come in early and sleep in the corner waiting for school to start she always had her nose in a book and was ready to speak up for others fleischman said she was very smart and opinionated even as a little girl i know why now fleischman said with a laugh but hernadez luna was shy when it came to one issue  where her family was from and her own citizenship i would stay quiet because i knew hernadez luna said she remembers her parents relief when congress under president ronald reagan passed the 1986 amnesty which granted legal status to an estimated 3 million illegal immigrants as her family sunk deeper roots in the us opening their own restaurant at a flea market hernandez luna decided she wanted to be a lawyer she pushed through high school graduating early at 16 and went on to the university of houston she gained citizenship at 18 and interned at the state capitol her junior year of college getting a taste for politics after graduation from uh she spent two years working at the capitol before enrolling in the university of texas school of law at age 25 she graduated from law school passed the bar and settled into her first job as a lawyer not long after she started one of the legislators she worked for before law school state representative joe moreno died in a car accident his staffers and supporters asked her to run in a special election for his seat she said and she obliged she took an eightmonth unpaid leave of absence from her new job to campaign she handily beat her opponent and at age 27 she started representing the people of district 143 a solidly workingclass predominantly hispanic neighborhood that sprawls alongside the houston ship channel east of downtown her immigration history didnt come up during the 2005 campaign she said when she faced off against another young hispanic candidate with powerful political backers ive never hidden the fact that i was born in mexico its on my bio born in reynosa she said at the time i ran in 2005 we really didnt have that antiimmigrant sentiment  hernandez luna said she has no aspirations for a higher office than the state house she is married to an attorney and practices law full time when the legislature is not in session and is talking about starting a family for now her attention is largely focused on the key breadandbutter issues for her constituents like the economy and the budget deficit immigration enforcement is a federal issue not one for state legislatures she said hernandez luna said she remembers the first time she shared her immigration story with fellow lawmakers it was a latenight committee meeting in 2007 attended by undocumented students speaking in opposition to a house bill that would deny them instate tuition when she was finished sharing her story she remembers riddle the republican from tomball saying something to the effect of youve been given a gift from god hernandez luna bristled my response to her was i

                          You're not dead? Texas officials' error-plagued effort purges live voters, too         	2012-11-03	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://blog.chron.com/txpotomac/2012/11/youre-not-dead-texas-officials-error-plagued-effort-purges-live-voters-too/	en	by lise olsen state election officials repeatedly and mistakenly matched  active longtime texas voters to deceased strangers across the country   some of whom perished more than a decade ago  in an errorridden effort  to purge dead voters just weeks before the presidential election  according to a houston chronicle review of records voters in legislative districts across texas with heavy  concentrations of hispanics or africanamericans were more often  targeted in that flawed purge effort according the chronicles analysis  of more than 68000 voters identified as possibly dead its unclear why so many more matches were generated in some minority  legislative districts one factor may be the popularity of certain  surnames in hispanic and historically black neighborhoods james  harris is one of thousands of harris county voters who got letters  asking if they were dead mayra beltran  houston chronicle one mismatch threatened the voter registration of james harris jr a us air force veteran who has voted in every presidential election since the richard m nixon era harris who is africanamerican and shares a name with a dead  arkansas man last voted in harris county in july yet inexplicably he  weeks later received a letter asking if he had died  apparently  because of the 1996 death of another james harris according to the  newspapers review harris voted early in the national elections without further incident   though he took along his voter card passport and birth certificate  just in case anyone wanted more proof he was alive harris told the  chronicle he hasnt been able to shake the feeling that someone has  gone to a concerted effort and gone to a lot of time and research coming  up with this matrix in a way of being able to knock people off of the  voting rolls  his daughter got a dead voter letter too she shares her name and birthday with a louisiana woman who died in 2010 rich parsons  a spokesman for the secretary of states office confirmed that  officials compared information about all texas voters  including many  who had voted since 2010  to longdead people in the social security administrations death database which dates back to 1973 so far 6491 voters identified have been purged he said not limited to race state officials did not use addresses middle names or voting history  to weed out false matches nor was race or ethnicity a factor parsons  said neither the official list of registered voters nor the social  security death master file contain any racial or ethnic data making it  impossible for race or ethnicity to play any role or impact in this  process he said indeed voters of all races received letters including republican state legislator wayne smith of baytown who is white he apparently was matched with another smith who died 1500 miles away in pennsylvania last year he also was one of more than 4000 smiths who made the state list parsons noted that no geographical information or addresses were used in the dead voter matchups i would also remind you the social security administration does not guarantee the accuracy of its own list he said an austin lawyer who successfully sued to slow the flawed purge was  apparently mixed up with a wisconsin resident dead since 2003  according to the chronicle review of social security administration  death data in an agreement reached in response to the travis county lawsuit  targeted voters were told they will not be purged unless their deaths  are confirmed but so far state officials have made no promises to  improve the matching process the settlement did not change or impact the process in any way said parsons more dead minorities houston chronicle graphic texas legislators passed a law in 2011 requiring election officials  to use social security administration death data to clean voter rolls last summer election officials prepared two lists one contained  8238 socalled strong matches  where voters names social security  numbers and dates of birth matched the dead it generated little  controversy a much larger list with more than 68000 weak matches  many based  on names and birth dates alone  wrought complaints protests from  dallas and harris county registrars and the civil suit in travis county the matching effort was overseen by state director of elections keith ingram  an attorney who has admitted he knew nothing about election law before  taking his current job according to statements hes made under oath he  previously oversaw appointments for governor rick perry texas voter data includes no ethnicity information however the  chronicle found voters living in legislative districts with high  percentages of hispanics or africanamericans were more likely to be  listed as dead than others statewide in fact voters in eight heavily  minority districts in dallas houston el paso and brownsville were  twice as likely to be targeted as voters statewide within dallas houston austin and san antonio voters living in  africanamerican or hispanic legislative districts created to improve  minority representation also were generally more likely to be listed  than those in surrounding counties the newspapers analysis found lawmakers alarmed state lawmakers including elections committee vice chair representative ana hernandez luna  a houston democrat already have pledged to review the process to  determine why so many voters were wrongly targeted her own district  which is heavily hispanic had a high match rate state representative barbara mallory caraway  a dallas democrat says she too wants to know why the analysis appeared  to have a disproportionate impact on districts like hers which has a  high concentration of africanamerican voters im obviously very alarmed and concerned about the possible  disenfranchisement of someones opportunity to vote   she told the  chronicle im concerned about the accuracy of the list  and id like  more of an investigation  one of the four texans who sued the state after being wrongly targeted was austin attorney andrew dylan wood  a longtime travis county voter whose father buck wood formerly  served as a texas director of elections andrew woods name was linked  to a wisconsin man who died in 2003 wood has voted at least eight times  since then his hope he said is that after the lawsuit that the secretary of  state doesnt do this any more that theyve had their experiment and it  did not work and they will figure another way to clear up the rolls 
One Question Remains	2010-03-01	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2010/03/01/one-question-remains/	en	what do you say about this governors race that the trailer was better than the movie that sometimes a super bowl featuring the two best teams in the league turns into a blowout that texans who vote with their middle fingers differentiate between the bums in austin and the bums in washington that the pundits who expected a barnburner were full of chorizo whatever the real puzzler is will there be a runoff no public poll or vote count in more than three years has had governor rick perry at or above 50 percent which is what he needs to finish this off the last time he saw that number was in the 2006 primary when he pulled 84 percent against three noname candidates he won the general with 39 percent against a democrat two independents and two lesser lights since then every poll has had him in the high 30s and into the 40s hes close though recent polls have perry under 50 but appear to have enough undecided votes to put him over the top the possibility of a runoff evidently changed the perry campaigns strategy they were talking just a couple of weeks ago about pulling down all of their negative campaign ads replacing them with biographical and closing commercials and sailing lyrically to the end but the glow around debra medina and kay bailey hutchisons relatively steady numbers apparently convinced the perry folks to stick to what they were already running as medinas vote was bigger than the difference between hutchison and perry a runoff was the only outcome after the debates medina was off the air without the money to stay on television with advertising and completely dependent on free media which is what campaigns call news coverage that almost assured a drop in her support even without mistakes she made mistakes  a couple of doozies like the 911 thing gaffe on the glenn beck radio show  but the possibility of a runoff lingers perry has kept the negative ads up for a while longer and added a new spot that has him sitting in front of a texas flag talking about the 10th amendment and keeping washington out of our business  theres a dog whistle in there with a frequency aimed at medina voters telling them that perry is with them on the antiwashington stuff and that its time to come home in the gop primary if he can shrink hutchisons numbers or medinas hell have a chance at a in without a runoff and then he can start worrying about a businessfriendly wellfinanced democrat who wants a crack at him in november former houston mayor bill white isnt a washington guy and that frame might be out of style by october anyway white is hoarding money while the republicans fight  farouk shami and the five other democrats in that race havent mustered serious support when the republicans are done and that could happen next week the race to define white will begin with him painting the rosy picture and the gop candidate painting the gray one the runoff date is april 13 the republicans will either wrap it up next week or play a version of groundhog day with six more weeks of hyperactive television advertising and theres a sidebar to that too a runoff would likely cost each of the contestants another 10 million if they plan to stay on the tube and keep up the fight perry wants to avoid a runoff with her numbers hutchison has to be hoping shell get six more weeks to try to win this thing and medina wants either a runoff or a new forum a race for us senate perhaps rick green the former state representative now seeking a gop nomination to the texas supreme court is running an old endorsement video on his facebook page even though the famous pitchman died almost two years ago it runs about a minute and has this tagline this is what charlton heston once said about rick green and his service to the state of texas  the endorsement from the late heston actor and nra jefe was loaded onto greens political facebook page one month ago  the site also features a video made for greens 2002 race for state legislature by motivational speaker zig ziglar hes still alive  a close of the campaign letter from houston democrat jarvis johnson to his opponent us representative sheila jacksonlee accuses her of stealing his yard signs and not just the ones with his name on them  the ones in his yard check it out we are astonished and disappointed to learn that your campaign is stealing our campaign signs i woke up this morning to find that my family friends neighbors and supporters throughout the 18th congressional district had their jarvis johnson for congress signs stolen from the private property in front of their homes last night even the campaign signs in my own front yard were stolen miraculously your signs were left intact  he went on to say that theyd prosecute anybody they catch just a few more days  the republican challenger in hd7 david simpson appears to be ramping down instead of ramping up his 8day report says hes only spent 2900 recently  as opposed to the almost 29000 he showed spending in his 30report incumbent representative tommy merritt rlongview is doing things more traditionally almost 80000 spent this past month compared with 8000 in his january report simpson raised 19000 while merritt reported almost 41000  in hd20 republican milton rister had quite the 8day report seeing 46000 in contributions a big jump from the 1900 he had in his 30day report the contributions include 2500 from social conservative james leininger of san antonio and 25000 of bob and doylene perrys money but even with the impressive gains charles schwertner is still outspending rister by quite a bit schwertner reported 123000 in expenditures for the last month  more than double what his three competitors spent combined the perrys also gave 25000 to stephen thomas who used to head the texas residential construction commission  an agency set up less than ten years ago at the behest of builders like perry and euthanized by the legislature last year with that funding all three major candidates in the primary appear to have mailers out hoping a last piece of mail might make the difference  in hd83 senator robert duncan rlubbock found himself in an uncomfortable position hes not endorsing either his legislative colleague representative delwin jones rlubbock or his former employee zach brady jones sent out a mailer showing him with duncan and soon had to fend off charges that he was faking an endorsement the lubbock avalanchejournal reported that jones said he was only asserting that duncan and he work as a team in austin brady took issue with that brady maintains a slight lead over jones in both contributions and expenditures going into the last week of the race he raised 71000 to jones 66000 third musketeer charles perry lags behind although he says all three candidates have mailers in the field  just because your opponent drops out doesnt mean your people move on representative terri hodge ddallas withdrew from her primary race after pleading guilty to federal tax evasion but some of her supporters are still urging residents not to vote for her challenger eric johnson hodge is asking people to stop pushing her name but if she wins the most votes the districts precinct chairs would choose a new candidate some of them want to but johnson has secured support from many of the sitting democratic lawmakers in the area and a majority of precinct chairs and this week he reported 67000 in contributions and endorsements from parent pac and the texas association of realtors  according to their most recent campaign finance filings victor leal raised significantly more money than his opponent walter four price iv in the leadup to the hd87 primary and his expenditures were proportionally greater as the race entered its final days leal had 8833051 on hand as compared to prices 7238176 the amarillo globenews noted that over 60 percent of

website fubiovcom and accepting the financial backing of extremists taylor gets sideswiped for telling the waco tribuneherald that he would stay in west south of waco stop for the kolaches whether or not he lost his 2006 bid for congress shortly before moving to plano reusing ads from his 2006 campaign in his current race and being a political carpetbagger  a spokesperson for the jackson campaign

grassroots campaign that is above board and without reproach richard says unfortunately one of my opponents has decided to attack me both personally and professionally and i can no longer sit idly by and allow these attacks to remain unaddressed  he says he was a rush limbaughinspired chaos voter in 2008 that his business property taxes have always been paid on time and in full and that his supporters are staunch conservatives who put their money where their mouth is  he even relaunched fubiovcom for those who want to dig around  or share their vacation experiences taylor also issued a response in which he characterizes the attacks as the most negative mail pieces in collin county history  far from trying to hide his 2006 run for us congress his campaign says he has repeatedly referred to the race in public forums  michael banks won a big victory in hd11 but it wasnt the primary the us supreme court denied an appeal by the city of dallas on a case that could have opened the door to turning a large expanse of east texas into a reservoir known as lake fastrill which would have been a cornerstone of the citys water plan instead the region will be a nature preserve banks

Best-Laid Plans	2009-10-19	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2009/10/19/best-laid-plans-1/	en	its hard to believe the governor saw this coming when rick perry decided to replace the a board on the eve of a hearing about the evidence that sent a texas man to the executioner he couldnt have been thinking the story would grow legs and stomp all around his bid for reelection he got testy with reporters this week taking a question about cameron todd willingham and turning it into a critique of the media of death penalty opponents and taking the opportunity to say again that the convicted murder deserves no sympathy the issue remains in play its a weird issue for a republican primary or for the states whole electorate for that matter voters in texas favor the death penalty gop voters favor it more than average but perrys two republican challengers  us senator kay bailey hutchison and wharton activist debra medina  found ways to work the story hutchison said perry is giving liberals ammunition against the death penalty medina said he should be protecting innocent lives though she didnt say willingham was innocent she said perry should go ahead with the states review of the case and if something was wrong that he ought to fix it before it happens again willingham was accused of setting his house on fire with his three kids trapped inside the question now is whether the fire was set intentionally willingham professed his innocence until he died the forensic science commission was about to look at the arson evidence when perry named new appointees instead of holding over the old ones since then hes answered questions about the case every day hes not the only candidate whose plans got scattered on another topic hutchison went on wbapam in the metroplex to talk about an endorsement from us representative michael burgess rflower mound and stepped in a hole when asked about resigning early to spend full time on the governors race hutchison who told the same station earlier this year that she plans to resign in october or november now says shes not sure what shell do or when shell do it the quote i am going to leave i think its important that i do everything i can when there are such huge issues and i havent been able to set that deadline which i know is something a lot of people are looking at to determine what other possibilities there might be i cant say anything right now because i dont know every day in washington some new bad thing is coming up  in the latest roundelay governor rick perry vigorously defended the states execution of cameron todd willingham calling him a monster and telling reporters theyve fallen under the spell of death penalty opponents willingham was executed for killing his children by setting fire to his house while they were trapped inside he professed his innocence until he died and recent reports have brought attention to an arson experts findings that the fire wasnt intentionally set perrys not buying it willingham was a monster he was a guy who murdered his three children who tried to beat his wife into an abortion so that he wouldnt have those kids person after person has stood up and testified to facts of this case that quite frankly you all arent covering perry told a gaggle of reporters after a speech to the texas association of realtors perry recently replaced members of the states forensic science commission on the eve of hearings into that arson report but thats not the story he said youre all being tied up in a processdriven story here with all these sideshows look at the details of the case we have a system in this state that has followed the procedures and they found this man guilty every step of the way you have one piece of study that everyone is glomming onto and saying aha perry said willinghams own lawyer has come to believe willingham was guilty the facts of this case clearly showed that this was a heinous individual who murdered his kids perry said his republican opponents both support the death penalty but took issue with perry on this case while i will agree that there are some crimes so heinous the death penalty is the only just punishment we must protect innocent human life said debra medina in a press release  if the governor cared about justice hed work hard to insure that the panels work is completed in all due haste that all the evidence is considered  and us senator kay bailey hutchison told the associated press that perry should have left the commission to its work i dont have the facts im not taking up for mr willingham because i have no idea im taking up for the process for the criminal justice system in our state she said houston mayor bill white raised 15 million in the third quarter of the year and hopes to spend that money running for the us senate his campaign says that brings the total contributions so far to about 6 million whites campaign didnt total their spending for the three months ended september 30 or how much money they had in the bank at that point and the full report was not yet posted on the federal election commissions website white had 37 million on hand at midyear fellow democrat john sharp had 31 million at that point and everyone else in the race lagged far behind state senator florence shapiro rplano has raised 1 million for a us senate race including 254020 raised during the third quarter and a total of 110000 she loaned her own campaign she ended the period with 555693 in the bank and she said in a press release that the money will be there if theres a special election for the us senate or if she has to wait until kay bailey hutchisons current term ends in 2012 former secretary of state roger williams says he leads the declared republicans in the us senate race with 13 million raised and almost 900000 on hand exact numbers will be available when his report is the reason we stuck declared in that last bit is because lieutenant governor david dewhurst could hop into the race and change the money rankings hutchison hasnt resigned and so dewhurst has said hell run for reelection and will reevaluate if anything else opens up that preserves his current position since nobody seems eager to run against the richest guy on the block but it keeps him out of some things like a us senate candidate forum in frisco on october 24 the texas medical association invited all of the declared candidates a list that doesnt include dewhurst not all of the federal candidates thirdquarter reports are posted online yet keep checking here as we will but there are some numbers worth noting representative ron paul rsurfside got to the end of september with 2 million in his bank account representative joe barton rennis had 18 million on hand former representative jim turner dcrockett had 1 million on hand only barton in that group has said he might be interested in running for us senate but theyve all got more money than most of the people whove said they are running of the texas candidates whose reports are online only barton raised big money during the quarter he raised 1 million in 90 days by emily ramshaw the texas tribune  emergency medical technicians and entrylevel nurses could be cut out of the telemedicine equation under a proposal the texas medical board is considering the change would prohibit anyone but doctors physicians assistants and advanced practice nurses from presenting patients for care via longdistance videoconferencing  a move rural hospitals and prison doctors adamantly oppose its an effort that appears to be designed to ensure telemedicine patients are receiving high quality care on both ends of the video camera  though officials with the medical board declined to comment tuesday on their motivation telemedicine advocates say it would hinder use of the technology in rural health centers where licensed vocational nurses and emergency medical technicians are often the only health care providers available in towns like turkey texas if you limit an emts ability to provide telemedicine people there will have to drive 80 miles for any kind of health care said don mcbeath the former head of texas techs telemedicine program who now advocates for the texas organization of rural and community hospitals its creating a huge barrier to the growth of telemedicine in rural areas  and they say it would force prisons which have limited nursing staffs to transport more inmates long distances for care  a security risk and drain on manpower we do 4000 telemedicine visits a month in the criminal justice system alone said dr ben raimer senior vice president at the university of texas medical branch which provides medical care for much of the states prison system this would be a very unfortunate setback for telemedicine in texas and result in a huge increase in cost for health care  its not texas doctors instigating the change brent annear spokesman with the texas medical association said many of the organizations doctors do participate in telemedicine and dont advocate doing anything that would curb its use telemedicine experts say they think the proposal is a result of good intentions run amok they say lawmakers made broad policy changes to improve medicaid telemedicine care in 2007  and that as a result the health and human services commission released its own set of recommendations on the technology they think the medical board took those recommendations one step further and excluded emts and certain types of nurses without realizing the potential consequences medical board officials didnt immediately clarify that a public hearing on the rule change is scheduled for november 5 we are receiving a large number of comments so its uncertain exactly what will be adopted said medical board spokeswoman jill wiggins wed prefer to wait until after the november meeting and see what comes out of that  advocates of the technology say another tweak the medical board is suggesting  one that would limit telemedicine to medically underserved areas  wouldnt affect rural health care but could affect its spread into impoverished urban communities by brandi grissom the texas tribune  advocates for legal immigrants who want texas driver licenses appealed to a panel of judges in austin this week the texas department of public safety has broad power to prevent some legal immigrants from getting drivers licenses attorneys for the state told the 3rd court of criminal appeals dps does have a large grant of authority to determine how licenses are given out in texas assistant attorney general erika kane told the threejudge panel the mexican american legal defense and educational fund this year sued dps over rules that prevent noncitizens from getting driver licenses if their legal status in the us expires in fewer than six months maldef argues that legislators have not given dps authority to implement the rules state district judge orlinda naranjo earlier this year issued a ruling that agreed with maldef and granted a temporary injunction to halt the new rules dps appealed the ruling and has continued to use the new rules under the dps rules adopted last october those whose legal status expires in fewer than six months are denied licenses even if they expect to renew their legal status the department also started printing temporary visitor in bright red capital letters on vertically oriented licenses for all noncitizens judge naranjo said dps overstepped its authority by implementing the rules without guidance from the legislature kane the states lawyer told the appeals court that the rules were adopted to prevent undocumented immigrants from obtaining licenses and continuing to stay illegally in the country since lawmakers during the recent legislative session did not pass any laws preventing the new rules she said there was no indication dps should change course the justices asked kane repeatedly to site a specific statute that gave dps authority to deny licenses based on immigration status i dont read the law as a limitless grant of authority to adopt rules said chief justice woodie jones kane said dps was allowed broad discretion to determine drivers eligibility including residency status maldef attorney david hinojosa told the court allowing dps to continue implementing the new rules would give other state agencies a green light to adopt rules without legislative direction they are essentially expanding their powers to determine who is eligible and who is not under the mask of these rules hinojosa said maldef filed the lawsuit on behalf of immigrants who were unable to obtain licenses and a dallas landscaping company whose employees were prevented from getting their licenses renewed the rules hinojosa said prevent legal immigrants from working and getting pay raises and hurt businesses that need employees to drive the maldef suit is one of two filed against dps over the new rules the texas civil rights project filed a similar suit in federal court arguing the rules are unconstitutional a ruling is pending in that case hinojosa said he was unsure when the appeals court would rule on maldefs case were hoping sooner rather than later he said by brandi grissom the texas tribune  texas should create a committee to promote participation in the 2010 us census state representative mike villarreal told governor rick perry in a letter the stakes are high villarreal dsan antonio wrote promoting participation in the census will improve our states chances of attaining the federal funding and political representation that our growing population deserves  like more than a dozen other states have done villarreal said texas should establish a complete count committee villarreal who is vice chairman of the house redistricting committee also urged perry to use state agencies to reach minorities the poor the elderly and others who might not otherwise be counted many state agencies already work with those populations and send them materials about public benefits villarreal said those agencies should use their contacts to let people know that the census is safe and that participating is important billions in federal aid for health care schools and roads depend on texas residents being accurately counted he said the census count also has huge political ramifications texas expects to grab three or four more congressional seats because of population growth which has largely been fueled by hispanic texans whether those new districts are drawn in a way that accurately reflects the states population is tied to who gets counted in the census and where they are villarreal said perry hadnt responded to his letter yet or even sent him flowers recently he joked perry spokesman chris cutrone said via email that the governor appreciated villarreals letter we understand this is an important issue and were looking into how best to serve the state on this issue he said ben bius is finished exploring and now says hell definitely run for the texas senate in sd5 where steve ogden decided not to seek reelection thatll pit bius against representative dan gattis of georgetown in the gop primary bius will do a series of campaign events and came out swinging at gattis referring to him as a personal injury trial lawyer and to himself as a businessman who supports putting an end to junk lawsuits  gattis countered that with an endorsement from the texas civil justice league  an austinbased foe of the trial bar  that was announced by red mccombs the head of that pac and a big republican funder in his own right gattis has a jump  hes been organizing the district longer  and a geographic advantage williamson county where gattis is domiciled has far and away the biggest voting population in the district bius is serious though hes claiming 100000 in pledged contributions for an event this weekend  every little bit helps but none of these democratic houston endorsers

scott hochberg kristi thibaut senfronia thompson sylvester turner hubert vo and armando walle  the texas association of realtors endorsed governor rick perry for reelection over his two challengers in

group has members all over the state  handy when its time to turn out votes in february and march us senator kay bailey hutchison got something of a headsup tar didnt have any reasons not to stick

Something Special	2009-06-15	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2009/06/15/something-special/	en	there will be a special session to finish work left undone by the legislature but the final date hasnt been chosen and governor rick perry has declined to say whats going to be on the agenda several issues have dominated the conversation about special session topics extending the lives of five agencies that were left to die at the end of the regular session authorizing the sale of 2 billion in transportation bonds approved by voters almost two years ago and changing state law to allow the texas department of transportation to proceed with publicprivate partnerships also called comprehensive development agreements or cdas and a revolving fund using those bonds to go forward without waiting for the next regular legislative session perry confined his remarks to renewing the expiration dates on five agencies the legislature stranded at the end of the regular session the way i see this these are really pretty simple to address and we can get in here and i think in a very short period of time take care of the peoples business and let the members get on back to their joyous vacations and whatever else they have going on  perry said well do it hopefully sooner rather than later  the senate closed the session on the first day of the month without voting to extend the lives of five agencies that were up for a periodic review if those sunset reviews arent completed in time lawmakers typically extend the automatic shutdown dates for the agencies in question that didnt happen this time because of a housesenate spat transportation insurance and three other agencies are now set to go out of business in september 2010 unless lawmakers return before then transportation has some particular problems to fix the expiration date is at the top of the list if the agency doesnt get its date changed officials there have doubts about whether they can legally let new contracts next on their list lawmakers didnt authorize the sale of 2 billion in bonds approved by voters in 2007 the state budget would let txdot sell the bonds starting in january but the agency cant do anything without the authorization that bond money is needed for about a third of the lettings in next years agency budget the legislature also stopped before approving a revolving fund that would have leveraged the transportation bonds  borrowed against them  to raise up to 5 billion more for toll roads and other projects and that ties into the cdas or partnerships between private firms and the state on toll roads and other projects that all goes on the back burner for two years if the legislature doesnt act that argues for a special session sooner rather than later but theres the matter of a political year in 2010 and perry wants to avoid anything that looks like things arent running smoothly in austin hell be running against us senator kay bailey hutchison arguing that things arent running smoothly in washington a legislative mess now could turn into a political mess in the march primary democrats fear perry will add voter id to the agenda if he calls a special session that could be an obstacle to a deal on the transportation issues perry could cut a deal with the democrats  fix transportation and well leave voter id alone  but that could upset his own supporters perry hasnt said for sure what will be on the agenda  and what wont but if he wants a short session as he has said its not likely that hell add anything controversial to the list house speaker joe straus released the names of 111 state representatives who he says have pledged to elect him to a second term as speaker in january 2011 straus says a few more names have trickled in since he released this list  hes now released two supplemental lists  and says hes confident hes got the support he needs for another two years in the job straus republicans hold a 7674 majority in the texas house a few of the democrats who pledged to the speaker did so he said with the understanding that theyll leave the fold if democrats win the majority in the next election cycle most just signed the pledge card he said straus hasnt presented the members with a set of ideas about what hed do with a second term  thatll come later he said but he wants to play a role in setting the agenda in his second session  something he didnt have time to develop in his sudden rise from sophomore member to speaker in january the full lists follow signed democrats 55 roberto alonzo carol alvarado rafael anchia valinda

fundraising by state law his primary challenger is not and says her finance committee will match contributions to her campaign from now until the end of the month in her latest pitch to potential supporters us senator kay bailey hutchison says her finance committee will match contributions but that comes after she takes some jabs at governor rick perry a fellow republican for what she calls mismanagement and a failure of leadership as i travel the state people have expressed frustration with the current leadership in austin they tell me the governor is putting his personal political agenda in front of an agenda that will move the state forward and you know what i agree with them she wrote we find ourselves at a crossroads people from all parts of texas feel it is time for a change in austin after nearly a decade in office our governor is not offering a clear vision of how we can solve the issues facing a changing state and there is a real sense that our leadership in austin is getting distracted and consumed attempting to clean up the mismanagement problems caused at the governors agencies picking a fight with the federal government is not a longterm strategy to move texas forward  the letter said elected state officials cant raise money during a legislative session or during the 20day veto period that follows that blocks perry and other texas pols from trying to fill their treasuries before the end of the current reporting period which ends june 30 but federally elected officials like hutchison arent bound by that law so she gets to work the circuit while he cant and its one reason why she should be able to show bigger numbers when those reports are unveiled july 15 once again the only thing the senator has to offer is negative washington rhetoric said perry spokesman mark miner after seeing hutchisons pitch the thousands of people moving to texas she mentions in the letter are the result of a fiscally responsible government jobs good schools and roads and low taxes all a result of the work by governor perry and the legislature if the senators idea of success is whats going on in washington all texans should be concerned  hutchisons entire letter is available online milton rister who resigned last week as executive director of the texas legislative council is exploring a run for the texas house rister a georgetown republican is looking at the hd20 seat currently held by republican dan gattis theres a string here that starts with speculation that senator steve ogden rbryan will leave the legislature he told the austin americanstatesman last week that hell make a decision in the fall gattis is a possible candidate for that senate seat and has told supporters hed be interested that would leave his spot open gattis says he talked with rister and thinks its a conditional thing gattis says he will definitely run for senate if ogden does retire in that case rister would run for the gattis seat rister reached later confirmed that saying hell support ogden and gattis if they seek reelection to the jobs theyve got now rister a former political consultant for former house speaker tom craddick and others held staff positions with senator jane nelson lieutenant governor david dewhurst and was executive director of the republican party of texas before signing on as head of the tlc three years ago he

and 42 percent in the second im shooting for 51 percent this time he says as expected comptroller susan combs says the state has all the money it needs for the budget lawmakers approved during the legislative session combs didnt comment on the economy or offer any reservations in  her letter to state leaders she just said theres enough in the till to cover the bills texas lawmakers filed 12226 bills and resolutions during the regular session or nearly 2000 more than they filed in 2007  the previous record year if you throw out resolutions  including the 190 proposed constitutional amendments the 372 nonbinding concurrent resolutions whose main purpose is to display the legislatures opinions and the 4245 plain resolutions mostly used for commemoration memorials and such  they filed 7419 house and senate bills thats more than ever  a 199 percent increase over the 2007 total take solace they passed 1459 bills  23 fewer than two years ago the statistics from the last ten sessions courtesy of the texas legislative reference library show the latest one was busier than average if down a bit from the last they were busier than average both in terms of bills filed and bills passed they set the record for filings but fell well short of the 1999 highwater mark of 1622 for bills passed they were off the charts with all their resolving stuff one number is still missing

March Madness	2009-03-23	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2009/03/23/march-madness/	en	our bracket says pitt will win the ncaa mens basketball championship that doesnt mean itll happen and if it does happen we wont be able to claim honestly anyway that we knew it was gonna happen well just have guessed right eds note after this was written pitt lost to villanova failed to make the final four ruined our bracket and painfully proved our point about predicting the future and theres no way to know right now whether the governor will call a special session in the summer unless your name is rick perry and youve been talking to yourself a summer special was the mediadriven rumor of the week at the capitol presumably on the state budget based on the notion that perry will veto the budget thats now being written etc etc etc the best thing you can say honestly anyway is that its too early to know whats going to happen with the budget the stimulus vetoes and all of that we have a theory however on why the rumor has traction and why the rumor of an unseatnewspeakerjoestraus petition got legs last week lawmakers gossip more than a church choir especially when theres nothing to distract them and in the house theres clearly nothing to distract them every session is odd in its own way this one has had a remarkably slow start the session is a few days shy of the halfway mark and the house has not yet considered a bill near the end of the week only 17 pieces of legislation had been moved to the house calendars committee  the panel that schedules what other committees have considered for a vote in the full house only 60 bills had come up for votes in the various house committees and only 23 had been reported from those committees  sent on their way to calendars the senate had passed 73 bills the standard line is that theres only one bill  the budget  that has to pass each session lawmakers are eternally optimistic 4706 bills have been filed in the house of 7152 total and there are 10 weeks left in the 20week session one of those 73 senate bills  voter id  got all the attention it passed unaltered and on a partyline vote it goes to the house which could have it up in committee in a couple of weeks the states biggest pension funds lost a combined 408 billion in value between the end of the fiscal year in august and the end of february and might soon be asking lawmakers for more money the market value of the teacher retirement systems assets dropped to 706 billion from 1049 billion or 327 percent the market value of the employee retirement system did a little better falling to 15 billion 215 billion a 302 percent drop the markets to blame but the costs will be borne by the state and the educators and state employees that contribute to those funds unless the markets turn around and earn all that money back a note these arent actual losses until and unless the funds sell their assets the lost value is the difference between what the assets were worth six months ago and what theyre worth now the market disasters put the legislature in a bind they probably need to send some money to the funds eventually so ers and trs can meet their obligations ers where the numbers are less bleak has 89 cents on hand for every 1 of liabilities at trs the plunge left 68 cents for every 1 in liabilities this is not rocket science says representative vicki truitt rkeller chair of the house pensions investments  financial services committee you get a market turnaround adjust the contributions or adjust benefits  she and others are still trying to figure out what needs to be done to the funds right away shes concentrating on calming retirees no ones in any danger of not getting their check  trs actuaries  irvingbased gabriel roeder smith  co  said in their assessment that lawmakers should wait before they do anything dramatic we believe the current financial environment is too volatile with future expectations too uncertain to create a longterm solution during this legislative session the trs actuaries said in their midyear report but the funds executive director suggested theyll be looking for money before lawmakers leave town the outlook has changed from neutral to consider some type of contribution increase  that would be very helpful ronnie jung told truitts committee and they recommended no unfunded benefit enhancements be considered by the legislature  to get the fund in shape for any extras they said would require the contributions from both the state and the educators to be raised above 9 percent each increase of one percent raises about 707 million for the retirement fund per year while taking it from the state budget or teacher paychecks or both at ers a smaller fund a one percent increase in contributions the corresponding number is about 55 million annually for trs the state contributes 658 percent of an educators pay the educator pays 64 percent the ers numbers 645 percent state and 6 percent employee that probably kills the idea of a 13th check  an extra months check for current retirees the actuaries again from their letter it is possible that the legislature could authorize a 13th check for retirees and separately fund these benefits outside of trs however we believe the first priority of the state should be ensuring the longterm viability of the system  the ers numbers while better still present some budget problems that combined 1245 percent of pay doesnt cover the normal cost of the fund  that would take an additional three percent representative john otto rdayton says hes not sure how much if any the lege will spend but it wont just come from the state otto whose appropriations subcommittee will look at ers says the employees should bear some of the costs too nobodys interested in cutting benefits truitt says were going to adjust the contributions and pray for a better market  the texas chapter of the current recession began with 2009 and the state was probably on the brink weeks or months before then according to the federal reserve bank of dallas texas is doing better than the country as a whole and the recession here began at least six months after the national downturn according to a new report from the fed key points  the leaders of the recession here energy prices hightech activity and exports  employment was up in the first half of 2008 but fell in the second half particularly in september hurricane ike gets the cite and then in november and december and the rates elsewhere are rising as more people lose jobs according to the fed the texas numbers rose because the labor force grew faster than jobs grew  home foreclosures inventories and mortgage delinquencies all grew in texas but less so than in other parts of the us prices here rose through the third quarter of the year even as they were plummeting elsewhere the fed expects them to dip this year  energy industry layoffs are expected this year too and the fed predicts the areas that led the upturn  permian basin and barnett shale drilling  will lead the way downhill  among the big cities austin and dallas have led the recession with houston continuing its growth but then theres this line in 2009 all the major metro areas in texas will likely experience recessions   unemployment in the state will rise by 28 percent  the equivalent of 296000 jobs  the nominations of texas workforce commissioners tom pauken and andres alcantar are on hold in the texas senate which is watching to see how the battle over unemployment insurance and the federal stimulus comes out governor rick perry appointed both men alcantar was on the guvs budget and policy staff before this pauken a dallas lawyer is a former head of the texas gop and has run for various offices over the years but the senator who heads nominations  mike jackson rla porte  says the hold isnt partisan and blames it on the stimulus tussle perry declared his opposition to the ui stimulus money  556 million worth  last week pauken had been working with lawmakers to find a way to accept the money without locking the state into unfunded federal mandates when that stimulus money is gone and a couple of republicans  senator kevin eltife of tyler and representative tan parker of flower mound  filed legislation last week that attempts to take the money and weaken the federal strings on it while that was developing jackson says a number of senators from both parties asked him to take pauken and alcantar off the nominations eligible list pending in the senate that allows senators to approve other gubernatorial nominees who like the twc pair have been okayed by jacksons committee he revised the list removing their names several members in the senate have questions theyd like to ask  he says theres no need to rush  he says pauken and alcantar could be up for confirmation in a couple of weeks  the expected deficit in the states unemployment insurance accounts could be erased with federal stimulus money and with the balance of an economic development fund in the governors office that texas enterprise fund got its money from the insurance fund in the first place representative jim dunnam dwaco told a group of reporters that the ui deficit will hit 800 million later this year most of that  555 million  could be covered if the state will accept federal stimulus money targeted at ui the other 245 million he said just happens to be the current balance of the tef im not gonna stand around and allow the governor to willingly create insolvency in the unemployment trust fund and double the tax on employers dunnam said governor rick perry said this week that he wants the state to refuse the federal ui money because it comes with some requirements he says could cost the state well after the federal money runs out dunnam and others dispute that saying the costs of those changes is far outweighed by the stimulus money and perrys way would result in larger tax increases for texas employers wholl be assessed for that deficit hes off for arlington where his house committee on the stimulus money will hold a public hearing this weekend perry taped a phone message urging republicans in that area to flood the hearing to tell the committee of their low regard for the federal stimulus dunnam and representative garnet coleman dhouston said they were at a loss to explain perrys desire to turn down the money coleman blamed national politics and suggested the governor and his republican peers around the country want to annoy the new administration taking money out of a proven job creation fund would be shortsighted and irresponsible katherine cesinger a spokeswoman for perry said in an email the best way to address unemployment in texas is by creating more jobs and thats exactly what the texas enterprise fund continues to do  house lawmakers started the discussion over states uninsured children by hearing testimony on proposals  some with ninefigure price tags  that would significantly expand public health insurance programs in texas advocates for the medicaid and childrens health insurance program proposals plead human decency  texas ranks last in the us in the percentage of children with coverage the proponents argue that expanding coverage will save healthcare providers and the government money in the long run but with budgeteers trying to hold costs down the cheapest initiatives are most likely to succeed and fiscal conservatives say they will resist throwing good money into what they consider a bad system in this first foray the house human services committee looked at more than two dozen bills in four general categories allowing parents to reenroll in childrens medicaid once a year instead of once every six months expanding chip to cover families with incomes from 200 to 300 percent of the federal poverty level improving the eligibility process for social service programs and specialized programs representative warren chisum rpampa a former house appropriations chair said before the hearing that he hasnt looked into specific proposals yet this session but is strongly against extending the child medicaid continuous eligibility period to 12 months from six he heads the texas conservative coalition which lists the decision to limit that period to six months as a conservative victory i have health care for my family and i pay it every month he said six months does not seem unreasonable to me and weve been very diligent about getting people to come in and fill out their stuff and try to make it really easy for them  witnesses provided visceral narratives about gaps in the states safety net representatives of physician and hospital groups also supported legislation designed to insure more people and shift the patient burden from emergency rooms to primary care providers testifying in favor of extending the child medicaid reenrollment period ofelia zapata of austin said her adult daughter had to quit her job after getting written up repeatedly by her employer for missing work to renew her three childrens health coverage and to go to the doctor zapatas daughter worked for maximus a private company under contract with texas to help enroll children in public health insurance programs the 12month reenrollment period is the industry standard for health insurance said a physician representing the texas medical association and other doctors groups the rev lisa hunt rector of st stephens episcopal church in houston spoke in favor of allowing families with incomes between 200 and 300 percent of the federal poverty level to purchase chip coverage with premiums on a sliding scale tied to their abilities to pay that would relieve pressure on small businesses wanting to make sure their employees have health insurance she says zapata and hunt came to the hearing as part of the texas iaf network a nonprofit coalition of organizations including religious ones that lobby for social causes chisum said hes open to a chip expansion if it involves families buying into the program and incurring no extra cost to the state anne dunkelberg associate director of the center for public policy priorities expressed cautious optimism that others in the gop could also be open to the idea obviously we still have republican leadership and a republican majority in both of our chambers weve also gotten encouraging signals on creating a chip buyin program its getting a warmer reception she said chisum does draw the line at offering chip outright to all families at 300 percent of the poverty level expanding chip like that is a step toward socialized health care that chisum doesnt want to take he says what were doing is moving our state every time we come back through the appropriations process closer and closer and closer to socialized medicine chisum said proposals to improve the states eligibility process are a continuation of longrunning battles once involving private contractors like accenture hired to enroll people in social service programs followed by significant drops in the number of clients in those programs texas republican voters prefer kay bailey hutchison over rick perry but the gap between the two is not that large and the actual vote is a year and a few million dollars worth of campaigning from now hutchison wins the support of 36 percent of the voters to perrys 30 percent nearly a quarter of those voters  24 percent  havent decided and 11 percent said theyd prefer a third candidate that adds up to 101 percent because of rounding the large number of people who are undecided in all of the election numbers suggest that while insiders and political junkies are paying attention to the runup to 2010 many texans are not tuned in yet said jim henson who heads the texas politics project among those who have a preference this early in the contest the perryhutchison race appears much closer than many people seem to think  pollsters at the university of texas at austins government department and the texas politics project polled 800 texas adults between february 24 and march 6 the margin of error in the internet poll is  35 percent its higher on the perry hutchison question   57 percent  since that was limited to republicans and not all texas adults unemployment and jobs are the biggest problem facing the country and the state according to those voters on the national level theyre also concerned about the banking crisiscredit crunch and by the national debt on the state level top concerns included banking and also mortgageshome ownershipforeclosures though the housing collapse has been much milder in texas than elsewhere in the us more people think the governor is doing a good job than think hes doing a bad one the legislature doesnt fare as well with about equal numbers of hoorahs and raspberries about twofifths  39 percent  approve of the job perrys doing while 34 percent disapprove for the lege those numbers are 30 percent to the good 30 to the bad theyre a bit more intense about the guv with 11 percent strongly approving his performance and 17 percent strongly disapproving president barack obama gets good marks from 45 percent of texans and crummy ones from 42 percent congress not so many fans 25 percent of texans approve of the national legislature while 53 give congress bad marks intensity is stronger with the national folk obama gets strong good marks from 29 percent bad ones from 30 percent congress is strongly approved by under four percent disapproved by 37 percent queried about issues texans want the legislature to take back control over college tuition rates 47 percent to 26 percent a third of the respondents said the top ten percent rule for college admissions should be left as is 25 percent would modify in some way and 22 percent would abolish it and 46 percent of those asked said state revenues should be increased to make college education affordable 15 percent said theyd address affordability only for the most needy and 14 percent said state revenues should not be increased to bring college prices down nearly half  45 percent think the public schools should teach evolution and creationism or intelligent design as competing theories shown an array of education proposals their favorites were higher teacher pay 27 percent publicly funded vouchers for private schools 19 percent and giving new funding to the states poorest school districts 16 percent just over half said standardized tests are unbiased measures of student performance only 12 percent of texans would ban gambling in the state another 17 percent would leave gambling laws unchanged about 13 percent would allow expansion only where its allowed now and 40 percent would allow full casino gambling texans arent crazy about immigrants 69 percent support ending instate college tuition for undocumented immigrants 59 percent support adding an englishonly amendment to the state constitution 48 percent would end bilingual education in public schools and 78 percent would require businesses to verify the immigration status of their workers and fine businesses that intentionally employ undocumented immigrants oh yeah that voter id thing working through the lege its favored by 69 percent of voters the pollsters in that new ut poll asked voters how they feel about various candidates who might be running for us senate if kay bailey hutchison steps down early to run for governor instead of a headtohead more on that in a second they had the respondents say where on a scale of 1 to 100 theyd rate their chances of voting for each of those candidates the results from top to bottom republican attorney general greg abbott 514 republican lieutenant governor david dewhurst 485 republican railroad commissioner michael williams 477 democratic former comptroller john sharp 472 democratic houston mayor bill white 454 republican railroad commissioner elizabeth ames jones 448 republican state senator florence shapiro 443 republican former secretary of state roger williams 441 they put each republican in a headtohead race with democrat sharp who outperformed only shapiro by one percentage point and roger williams by four points they did it with white too who outdid williams by one point and ran behind everyone else abbott did best in those fantasy matchups followed by michael williams attorney general greg abbott says the state has the right to make sure cities comply with federal immigration law the texas legislature is not prohibited from adopting some form of legislation designed to compel local governments to comply with any duties they may have under federal immigration laws so long as such legislation is not inconsistent with federal law  gobbledygook it means state lawmakers can tell texas cities they cant become sanctuary cities under federal law  four of the nations metro areas grew by more than 100000 people in the 12 months that ended in mid2008 and two of them were in texas dallasfort worth added 147000 people according to the census bureau and houston added 130000 harris dallas and tarrant counties were among the ten

up revenue estimate ouch base budget tight president sworn in twice all but one startup ceremony is over governor rick perrys state of the state speech is set for tuesday of next week lieutenant governor david dewhurst hopes to name senate committees by midweek the houses rules will be available for viewing early next week with a vote maybe at midweek and no promises of when house speaker joe straus will name committees history which isnt reliable is that theyre in place in the first week of february or so but whos in a hurry with the exception of eminent domain legislation perry hasnt showed his hand on priorities  those will come tuesday  and hasnt proclaimed any emergency issues that would allow bills to be considered in the first 60 days of the session the rush will be on later but not now lieutenant governor david dewhurst starts the session with a short list of priorities dive right in 1 the budget this the first version laid out this week is just a preliminary draft we will not have as much money as we thought we were going to have because of the pessimistic revenue estimate from comptroller susan combs dewhurst touted his efforts last session to put some money aside to cover the structural deficit started in 2006 when the state promised to pay local school districts more than its new business margins tax can produce he wants to do that again weve got to maintain our balances or were going to be looking at some large deficit numbers in 2011  thats not what i want to do  2 some sort of property tax reform the legislature has knocked down property tax caps  local governments argue that the state is trying to cut off their revenue without any regard to costs of services taxpayers can force rollback elections when taxes go up eight percent or more dewhurst would like that lowered to five percent 3 improvements in public education he and some senators steve ogden rbryan and florence shapiro rplano want to revisit school finance formulas this session though there are questions of whether the lege will go along when theres not an immediate crisis the draft budget includes 2 billion in new spending beyond whats needed to cover enrollment growth he said and he wants to create a testing system that tracks individual students growth and achievement as they go through school that goes beyond just standardized testing and he wants to kill taks  the states standard test  and replace it with endofcourse testing 4 higher education needs more flagship universities this is a decadelong process it is also important that we consider carefully tuition increases we cant afford to price people out of college  he said money will be too tight to do all he wants but said more money should go into funding formulas for colleges 5 texas department of transportation dewhurst wants to a revolving fund levered to build new roads he noted the 5 billion in bonds authorized but not yet sold for transportation he said hes been pushing txdot for a list of priority projects that started large and is now whittled down to 2025 billion thats doable  6 the lite guv wants to trim the number of uninsured texans which he puts at 56 million including 900000 children we have dramatically increased chip childrens health insurance program enrollment and need to sign up more kids dewhurst said healthcare is too expensive which he attributes in part to cultural differences some of our cultures wait until theyre really sick until they come in for medical attention  he also said american is the only country in the world that pays doctors on the basis of the number of procedures they perform not on wellness im totally convinced that our model is unsustainable  and he says hell propose a pilot program to illustrate the point and try to encourage transformational change  7 clean air and the environment he said essentially that the legislature needs to add to what its already done dewhurst laying all of this out at a lunch for the media scattershot his way through other topics saying a fair voter id bill is important that immigration is really a federal problem that could be helped by more border patrol officers you know how many cops we have on the border 16000 you know how many cops they have in new york city 50000  he plans to announce committee assignments midweek next week eds note his estimate two years ago turned out to be very optimistic he wont support indexing the gasoline tax calling it the last thing you want to do when times are tough dewhurst expects the federal bailout to send 15 billion to texas for medicaid public education infrastructure and some flexibility on how to spend it but he wasnt specific about how much money would go to each of those things two years after vetoing legislation limiting governments power of eminent domain governor rick perry wants to include something similar in the state constitution senator robert duncan rlubbock and representative rob orr rburleson authored the version hes endorsing two years ago the issue came up in the form of a proposed state law  strongly backed by the texas farm bureau the texas and southwestern cattle raisers association the texas public policy foundation and other groups that have been at the front of property rights fights  that passed the senate unanimously and in the house by a 12511 vote perry supported it until lawmakers made some changes he objected at the end because the law made concessions to landowners he thought were too expensive compensating them for altered access to their property and for permanent changes in views and traffic patterns resulting from government projects without those things he said two years ago hed have signed it a constitutional amendment has to pass both chambers of the legislature with twothirds support unlike a law it goes to voters for approval or disapproval and not to the governor the issue came up  lightly so far  in a fundraising letter sent by us senator kay bailey hutchison to potential supporters shes planning to run for governor against perry and played the property rights issue against perrys expansion of toll roads and state highway projects  while were sort of on the subject of the governors race perry is scheduled as a featured speaker at an antiabortion rally in austin on saturday the texas rally for life is billed as a peaceful commemoration of the tragic 1973 roe v wade decision  and hutchison will be in austin this weekend to meet with supporters and policy folks who are helping her exploratory bid for the state governments highest executive office behind the partisan hullabaloo over the senates twothirds rule lurks an actual public policy debate over voter id but democrats and republicans each claim the others policy brief is hollow and strictly partisan democrats say voter id will suppress voting among minorities the elderly and the disabled and that the result is more harmful to their candidates than to republicans republicans say their legislation has safeguards in place to keep that from happening academic research offers contradicting results when it comes to turnout and voter id so both parties have some numbers to back up their side republicans say voter fraud is a big problem theyve got some numbers but few that illustrate serious inperson voter fraud democrats contend the level of fraud is too small to risk keeping any eligible voter from the polls supporters say requiring voters to show a photo id would restore integrity to a broken election system where they contend its too easy for dead people or nonus citizens to vote and for people to vote more than once but its tough to tally up votes of the nonbreathing and the undocumented which is why some in the gop say raw numbers are hard to come by looking back at signatures and voting records its easy to establish if something didnt look right says representative betty brown rathens the lead author of the house version hb 125 after the fact its so hard to determine and theres no way to prove it thats the problem with prosecuting  there is so little definitive evidence our das are busy pursuing murders and rapists they dont always have time to stop and prosecute someone whos voted illegally  brown points to a 2008 case where 4000 dead people were still on the voter rolls in harris county one of those voted in the primary paul bettencourt thenharris county tax assessor and voter registrar testified before congress in 2006 that 35 nonus citizens had applied or registered to vote brown says its too easy for someone to just take a voter card to the polls and vote as someone else jerry strickland communications director for the office of the attorney general says the ag has found 30 voterfraud suspects in the past few years and 22 have been prosecuted the crimes range from voting in a dead persons name voting twice and filling out registration cards for people who dont exist the texas gops executive director eric opiela cites some examples of fraudulent voter activity in nov 2007 state auditors found that more than 49000 ineligible voters mainly felons and dead people were registered throughout the state no one found evidence of votes cast by those voters he also points to a 2008 case in the alice area where one canvasser filled out 50 mailin ballots belonging to politically apathetic friends and family in support of an uncontested democratic candidate for district attorney that case was prosecuted under existing law keeping nonus citizens from the polls is certainly an element in the legislation though senator tommy williams rthe woodlands emphasizes that finding and prosecuting undocumented workers is not still cathie adams an election judge in dallas and leader of the conservative texas eagle forum says undocumented workers are a threat to election integrity opponents of the voter id legislation argue that undocumented workers are happy to stay far away from the polls  and any place associated with the government but adams contends that as undocumented workers begin to have children in the us their stake in government grows along with the chance theyll start voting along with their assertion that voter id will solve inperson voter fraud republicans say they have a key argument in their favor a nonpartisan poll done by the university of texas at austin shows 52 percent of texas strongly support voter id and 18 percent somewhat support it heres how they got the sample plus the us supreme court has ruled favorably on voter id legislation in other states this is clearly a bipartisan issue supported by large majorities of both republicans and democrats says opiela the only people opposed are democratic legislators and party leadership who use it as a way to energize partisan activist groups and raise money  williams emphasizes that voter id wouldnt be too cumbersome and shouldnt affect elderly disabled or minority voters you could show up to the polls with a utility bill and a library card or a pilots license and a piece of mail addressed from a government agency to your home and youll be ok he also points to a university of missouri study showing turnout in democraticleaning counties to increase slightly in indiana after the state enacted voter id democrats dont like it i think the most compelling argument against voter id is whats being proposed is a solution to a problem that doesnt exist says boyd richie chairman of the texas democrats and there is some research showing voter id suppresses voting a brown university study found that between 19942004 states with voter id laws saw an increase in voter registration for anglos of about 15 percent but a decrease in voting by 10 percent for blacks and hispanics voter registration stayed the same but voting decreased by 14 percent and 20 percent respectively another report by rutgers university and ohio state university found voting in the 2004 presidential election decreased by about 3 percent in states with voter id laws for hispanics that decrease was about 10 percent and for blacks 57 percent representative rafael anchia ddallas who has served on the elections committee for two sessions says anywhere between 150000 and 500000 texans would be unable to comply with the voter id bill even with all the options like bringing utility bills or divorce decrees senator mario gallegos jr dhouston says it sends a bad message to texans when lawmakers are fighting over voter id rather than working on health care the economy or restoring galveston after hurricane ike he and senator john whitmire also dhouston say democratic voter turnout is likely to drop at least 3 percent if the sb 362 passes but whitmire says its unlikely to pass the house anyway but house speaker joe straus said recently on texas monthly talks that he voted for similar legislation in the past and doesnt object to it coming up this session  by karie meltzer how many votes does it take to win political districts start each decade after redistricting at equal population size that doesnt mean the same people vote in each place but that the same number live in each district but wait a few years add in growth migration voter turnout competition election day weather and you get widely disparate results it matters mainly if youre watching changes in voting patterns or starting to work on the next set of redistricting maps thatll get drawn in two years and for bragging rights if youre a legislator and for targeting if you dislike a legislator think of it like this at the top of the ballot a candidate in 2008 had to get 4038536 votes to win at the bottom just 6675 lookit       in cd10 333083 people voted in the general election in cd29 less than one third that many  106794  voted us representative lamar smith rsan antonio got 243471 votes  the highest for any one candidate us representative gene green dhouston got 79718  the fewest for any winning candidate he ran in cd19  the lowvote district fourteen candidates lost their contests with more votes than he got winning his the average race for congress in texas drew 235269 voters us representative kevin brady rthe woodlands got 207128 votes  the highest number gathered by anyone with a majorparty opponent and larry joe doherty a democrat got 143719 votes while losing to us representative michael mccaul  thats the most votes collected by any congressional loser this time out that race was in cd10  where the highest number of votes were cast nine people who got fewer votes that doherty in other districts won and took the oath of office earlier this month  the numbers in senate districts were similar 296160 in sd10 at the top of the list and 104207 in sd6 on the bottom senator mario gallegos dhouston came to austin with the fewest number of votes for a winning senator at 72960 hes from sd6 four candidates lost senate races with more votes than that about 199859 people voted in the average senate race last year at the top of the list senator craig estes rwichita falls who ran opposed and got 221470 votes senator mike jackson rla porte got the most votes of a winner with a majorparty opponent former senator kim brimer rfort worth got 140737 votes in his loss to senator wendy davis dfort worth  thats the most votes collected by a losing senate candidate and they were competing in sd10  the senate district where the highest number of voters turned out only 15 of the 31 senate seats were on the ballot in 2008  the terms are staggered and brimer finished right in the middle of the pack with eight of the winners getting more votes than he got including davis and seven winning with fewer votes  the toptobottom difference in the texas house was stark with 13348 people voting in hd140 on the low end and 103536 voting in san antonios hd122 on the high end representative armando walle dhouston won in the first representative frank corte rsan antonio in the second the average house race attracted 47401 voters representative ken paxton rmckinney got more november votes than any other house member with 73450 for ana hernandez dhouston 11881 was enough for victory she got the lowest vote total for any winner a large number of candidates  63  lost their races with more support than hernandez got winning hers the top loser  that is the one with the most votes  was republican donna keel of austin for whom 43190 votes were not enough to defeat representative valinda bolton there are 137 people calling themselves representative today who got fewer votes than keel got  texas court of criminal appeals judge cathy cochran was the top vote getter in the state with 4719538 votes next was the republican presidential ticket john mccain and sarah palin pulled 4479328 all of the statewide republican candidates outran the topperforming democrats barack obama and joe biden led the blue team with 3528633 sam houston the toprunning democratic state candidate he ran for supreme court finished 3492 votes behind his partys national ticket  the presidential contenders attracted 8077073 votes more than half a million were gone by the time they got to congress  a total of 7528622 texans voted in those 32 races and nearly half a million more were gone by the time they got to the texas house races those contests  150 of them contested and not  drew 7110093 votes almost one of every eight people who voted for president didnt vote for a state legislator  want to fool with the numbers for all of the statewide sboe congress senate and house candidates heres our spreadsheet  knock yourself out state lawmakers start with a split on the state budget with the senate planning to spend 1715 billion and the house looking at 1708 billion and both plans would require the state to dip into its rainy day fund to balance the budget the two houses generally agree on the starting budget and on which chamber will start the process its the senates turn to start this year which means thats the bill budgeteers will work from but the change in leadership in the house means theres not yet an appropriations chairman there so they start with different numbers both startup documents are posted on the legislative budget boards website theyre at the top of the first column on the left side of the page and theyre big the summaries are online too senate and house both proposed budgets spend more than the comptroller says the state will have available meaning that theyll dip into the rainy day fund that there are cuts to be made or that the legislature is counting on a revised and more optimistic set of numbers sometime between now and june 1 when the legislative session ends comptroller susan combs said last week that budgetwriters will have 771 billion available for general spending and a balance of 91 billion in the rainy day fund during the coming budget cycle the senates budget as presented requires 838 billion in general spending the houses is a little lower at 834 billion theres an accounting twist in one of those numbers about 3 billion is available for public schoolproperty tax spending and is in a special account but it counts as general revenue so add that to the 771 billion thats available for lawmakers to spend bottom line this preliminary version of the budget would dip into the rainy day fund for about 37 billion the senate proposed higher spending than the house in two areas they budgeted for settlement of disability claims related to a federal investigation of state mental facilities and they fully funded pay incentives for public and higher educators senate finance chairman steve ogden rbryan thinks its a tight budget but doesnt expect cuts and hes got some projects going if he and others can pull together votes for a public school finance bill theres 18 billion in contingent funding that could go to schools he calls the money for mental health facilities pretty ambitious and hopes it will answer federal civil rights questions about texas state schools transportation could get money from 5 billion in bonds approved by voters but not yet sold or appropriated and he and others are concerned about the economic blowout and what it could mean for teacher and employee retirement plans and for a trust fund thats usually good for more than 1 billion in public education funding dont be surprised if the numbers on both the spending and revenue sides wiggle around during the next four months while legislators write the budget after a debate that brought national attention to texas the state board of education voted in favor of teaching evolution as an unquestionable theory rather than an imperfect hypothesis since 1998 the school science standards part of teks texas essential knowledge and skills  have included this phrase the student is expected to analyze review and critique scientific explanations including hypotheses and theories as to their strengths and weaknesses using scientific evidence and information  many science educators and parents have urged the board to delete those words arguing they allow teachers to include discussion of creationism and intelligent design in the classroom strengths and weaknesses is a way to sneak creationism through the back door dr eugenie scott of the national center for science education told the board at a public hearing its a way of attacking evolution  but some  board members teachers and conservative groups alike  say the words allow academic freedom that teaching evolution as the final word is censorship that quashes critical thinking we need to allow teachers to discuss this with our kids said board member barbara cargill evolution is not tidy  cargill is strongly aligned with her colleague cynthia dunbar who led the fight on keeping strengthsandweaknesses after the board voted 77 member rene nuez was absent the language was thrown out and dunbar pulled out her backup students should analyze evaluate and critique scientific explanations by using empirical evidence logical reasoning and experimental and observational testing by examining scientific evidence supportive and not supportive of those explanations  that went

Gloomy, but Still in the Black	2009-01-12	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2009/01/12/gloomy-but-still-in-the-black/	en	you remember when speaker tom craddick said the state was sitting on a 15 billion budget surplus that was only eight months ago and now lawmakers budgeteers and various soothsayers are telling agencies and other supplicants this legislature will be writing a tight tight budget the 15 billion was never really a surplus but the state was in good financial shape and  compared to most other states  remains so and part of this is the normal budget whittling that precedes a session its easier to say no when theres no money than to say no when the state is flush but the economy hurricane ike state laws on education funds federal investigations of state mental facilities and a mess of other details are making it easy to cloud the outlook theres more here than the usual rhetorical trick comptroller susan combs will present her biennial revenue estimate on monday morning  a day before legislators come back nobodys seen it but the budgeteers expect it to be gloomy some things they know sales tax income is still up but the rate of increase has slowed considerably hurricane ike will cost up to 2 billion state law prohibits the states education endowment from making payments when returns fall below a certain amount over ten years the market drop triggered that apparently the attorney general has been asked to read the law closely to find an out and the state might not get 15 billion to 23 billion it expected the state board of education is having a special meeting on tuesday  before the legislature meets  to talk about that issue and try to produce something good for budgetwriters to talk about the states new business tax underperformed estimates and the economic downturn could dampen those numbers even more and the state has a structural deficit in the school finance swap approved by lawmakers in 2006 they promised to spend more on local school tax cuts than they are raising with the new business tax the difference each year  up to 5 billion  has to be made up with other funds theyll start with a cash balance of about 2 billion two years ago the corresponding number was 88 billion to a budget writer that looks like a 68 billion hole to fill since the lower balance amounts to a loss in the amount of funds available at the start and whenever you hear someone talk about job growth in the state know that those numbers figure into the formulas for some federal funds  like medicaid the better off we are relative to other states the lower the matching funds for budget purposes thats another leak in the pail texas has about 66 billion in its rainy day fund but thats onetime money and in a slow economy anything spent now might not be replaced anytime soon budgeteers are  at least at the outset  saying they dont want to spend that money comptrollers and their revenue estimators are always pessimistic  if you make a mistake on the estimates its better to be low than high go low and youve got more money than you expected go high and youve got a sea of red numbers this is an ideal environment for a numbercruncher who wants to make a pessimistic estimate joe straus iii is poised to become the first san antonio speaker of the texas house in 96 years the first baby boomer in the job and only the second republican since reconstruction his victory capped a weekend of intrigue that was a tense unpredictable textbook case of how fast things can change in politics played in reverse it all looks logical but every step along the way was fraught with intrigue and uncertainty  straus has a transition team helping to organize his office as he prepares for the vote that will make him speaker of the texas house next tuesday former state senator and bexar county judge cyndi krier and former representative clyde alexander  a republican and a democrat  head the crew others on the inside lisa kaufman executive director and general counsel at the texas civil justice league and a former staffer in the texas senate and the us congress and denise davis a lawyerlobbyist with baker botts and a controversial former house parliamentarian  after meeting on monday afternoon with several fellow conservatives whod been loyal to current speaker tom craddick representative john smithee ramarillo drops his bid for speaker and says he and representative dan gattis rgeorgetown will support straus theyre the last remaining candidates the numbers became obvious smithee says we had to get some of our people back and we went the other way i knew the odds were very long so it was either surrender yesterday sunday or try something ive tried to do it in a respectful and courteous and professional way and i hope that ive done that  it turned out that members whod made the hard decision to leave craddick and found themselves with a winner in straus werent willing to go through the wringer again representative will hartnett rdallas tells reporters that the group of republicans whod agreed to support smithee will drop their opposition to straus  straus says hes won the support of more than 100 of the houses 150 members  straus holds a press conference in the capitol rotunda to announce hes got 93 signatures from members and expects to be elected speaker of the house at the beginning of the session on january 13 its time to turn the page and to move to a more positive tone in the house and thats what im dedicated to he says in front of a bank of cameras and a throng of reporters staffers lobbyists and other gawkers that fills the floor the balcony on the second floor and a good part of the thirdfloor balcony he praises craddicks service to the state takes care to say this is not a fully completed project and says he hopes to meet with smithee to talk about the situation straus also answers reporter questions about his familys gambling interests saying hell beware of conflicts ill stay away from it ill recuse myself and not allow that to be a distraction   although straus claims the support of well over half the house a group of craddick republicans  57 by smithees count  agrees over dinner to support smithee to replace craddick they dont release the vote list but say they considered five candidates before voting to support smithee including representatives warren chisum dan gattis john otto and vicki truitt it comes down to smithee and gattis and the group votes unanimously craddick tells the group he got out of the race when he realized he couldnt win and he realized he couldnt win he told them when he lost the support of a handful of democrats who had supported him in the past his press office issued a brief statement when it was over tonight tom craddick released his pledges for speaker  afterwards smithee repeats his argument that members who have committed their support to straus should reconsider now that craddick is out of the race and smithee has taken his place as straus competition he and others in the craddick group say they are concerned that most of straus initial support comes from democrats their fear is that hell be beholden to democrats rather than to republicans  on sunday evening straus announces hes got the votes to become speaker and releases a list of the 15 republicans and 70 democrats who support him he says hell hold a press conference the next day the needs of special interests and partisanship will take a back seat to doing what is right for our state at this critical time he says in a press release it is time for a new tone and an atmosphere of trust in the texas house of representatives having received the commitment of a strong majority of my colleagues it is my goal to restore civility fairness and transparency to the house of representatives and its publicpolicy making process   smithee says the house should have more than two days to decide between him and straus and makes a play to straus supporters to reconsider now that craddick is out of the race he claims gattis support i dont know if its too late to try to make the case or not he says  craddick folds late sunday afternoon saying he cant get the votes he needs to win a fourth term as speaker he frees his pledges knowing straus has locked up more than half of the members and that his tenure is over any other candidate will have to scoop up all of craddicks voters and persuade some of straus to switch  smithee whos been in colorado for the holidays sends papers to the texas ethics commission allowing him to campaign for speaker joining candidates craddick gattis and straus straus has been moving rapidly during the last 48 hours to lock up the 76 votes needed to win in the 150member house gattis has been in the contest for a while with three other members pledged to him and craddick has been trying to get a majority of the votes since the november 4 elections without success craddick has called a meeting with supporters at a downtown austin steakhouse tonight a meeting that was on the books before the weekend began smithees play will only work if straus is short of the 76vote mark and if craddick drops out and frees his supporters to go with someone else if they chose smithee over straus and gattis thatd be that at this point the arithmetic and the timing appear to favor straus smithee and gattis are now contending for two groups uncommitted craddick opponents and people whove been with craddick to this point but who could become available if they think theyre not with a winner theyre after people who dont think craddick can or should get there and who dont want straus for whatever reason the question with craddick and straus working so hard is whether there are enough votes available to make gattis or smithee a viable candidate meanwhile conservatives outside the house continue their attacks on straus who comes from a san antonio clan with deep republican roots for his familys gambling interests they own a share of the retama park horse track near san antonio and for his views and votes on abortion he sends members an email saying in part as you know i believe in the sanctity of life i am consistent with existing restrictions on abortion including parental notificationparental consent i believe exceptions should exist for rape incest and harm to the life of the mother   straus works the phones and meets with members on saturday while democrats caucus and collect votes they reach the upper 50s on saturday and add a dozen more on sunday craddick and straus both talk to socalled craddick ds  democrats whove supported craddick six of ten join straus followed later by three more  late friday night conservatives like david barton of wall builders and cathie adams of the texas eagle forum launch email campaigns against straus attacking his familys gaming interest and his votes on abortion parental rights casino gambling and homosexuals as foster parents they express concern about his short tenure in the house and about the fact that most of his supporters are democrats  eleven republicans whove agreed to oppose craddick and to pool their votes behind one candidate meet ten in person one by teleconference at byron cooks austin residence and after three ballots pick straus burt solomons of carrollton got five votes on that third ballot to straus six participants said the winner 49 was in third grade when craddick was first elected to the house in 1968 straus was elected in 2005 straus files as a speaker candidate from the meeting at cooks house hes been considering a candidacy for weeks but didnt decide he told reporters until he got to the meeting gattis is still in the race and smithee is openly thinking about it

run for speaker he wants to talk to craddick first and the weeks events begin on monday december 29 when house democrats release five pages of signatures from 64 of the 74 democrats wholl be in the house this year theyve pledged not to vote for another craddick term craddick aides question the signatures suggesting some of the signers have also promised to vote for the incumbent they dont name names and nobody on the list protests that their name is being used without permission the ten democrats who didnt sign became targets for craddick and for the abcs hoping to unseat him and the game is on were keeping this vote sheet handy on the theory that you and we will be referring to it in the future thats what happened last time right a little history straus presented 85 names in claiming victory the list grew later craddick after the 2002 election that put republicans in the house majority had 102 on his list though both are republicans straus had 70 democrats and 15 republicans on

your list of potential candidates for texas attorney general in 2010 its not open at the moment but if it opens up hell be among the interested parties and were told hell file papers this quarter allowing him to raise state campaign money for that gig ag greg abbott is looking at possibilities ranging from lieutenant governor to us senate the implication there is that abbott would run for whichever is open if and when kay bailey hutchison resigns from the senate if lieutenant governor david dewhurst runs for reelection abbott would go for the federal deal if dewhurst runs for the federal deal abbott would run for the state gig the filing deadline for both races is in the first days of january 2010  about 12 months from now mccaul starts with an empty federal campaign purse but hes personally wealthy and will be getting an early start raising money for the state race abbott had 8 million in his state campaign account at midyear none of that is transferable to a federal account since the state doesnt limit contributions and the feds do to 2300 per person hed have an initial advantage in a state race but would start at scratch in a federal race the ags office is on

for now she has talked about running for ag in 2010 shes a democrat and might yet do so but shes going dormant for now us senator kay bailey hutchison started the new year with a series of fundraising letters dissing governor rick perry and asking for support for her exploratory committee for governor shes thinking about running in 2010 and perry says hell be seeking reelection that sets up a noisy primary a year from march ten years of one man in the governors office has left challenges unanswered too little trust and consensus and too much infighting she writes in the fundraising letter this tone comes from the top and we can do something about it  she hit some themes youll probably hear if theres a race noting that the state budget has doubled over ten years that our state government ignores private property rights and property owners in a quest to cover our state with massive toll roads and raising questions about scandals in the texas youth commission and state mental facilities

Ghosts and Other Scary Stuff	2008-05-26	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2008/05/26/ghosts-and-other-scary-stuff/	en	travis county prosecutors have issued subpoenas in their investigation of the socalled ghost worker case the primary house committee investigating that affair has as a result pulled up a second committee hasnt changed course but could and the piles of open information requests from politicians partisans and the press should start yielding some results in the next week or so we have an actual investigation that is ongoing said gregg cox an assistant travis county district attorney i cant comment on the particulars  he said the investigation began with reports that some staffers at the capitol work parttime but are recorded as fulltimers who receiving fulltime benefits cox wouldnt talk about which laws might be in question or which legislators but he did say hes talked to the chairmen of two house committees to make sure they dont accidentally grant immunity from prosecution to any of their witnesses the house can make you testify but if they do it while youre claiming itll incriminate you youre protected from prosecution cox wanted to make sure the house committees were aware of that and didnt mess up possible future prosecutions that interest among other things prompted one committee to abort its investigation representative larry phillips the sherman republican who chairs the general investigating and ethics committee had planned to look into reports that some house members have been listing parttime employees as fulltimers a cheat that gives those workers free health insurance his aim was to look at whats been going on and to consider changes in law and house rules that would clear up the practice in the future but phillips backed down after talking to prosecutors he said hes not closing the door on a future investigation by his committee though the public wants to make sure theres a thorough investigation  phillips had been promising a full vetting of the issue and was fending off other legislators who wanted him to open all of his hearings to the public a trio of democrats asked for that and also said phillips should include consideration of new rules governing the people who work for legislators in the lower chamber phillips committee had two pieces of business and presumably could restart first theres the issue of whether anyone in the house has been doing anything thats against house rules or state law thats the likely focus of the prosecutors second phillips planned to have his committee look at changes in the rules and possibly the law to keep future lawmakers on track if there are things that are happening that dont make sense or arent appropriate that needs to stop he says i dont think its that complicated  in their letter to all members of the house the three democrats  representatives garnet coleman of houston jim dunnam of waco and craig eiland of galveston  wrote that the meeting should be open to the public they say no one has pointed to a violation of law or house rules and say the closed session cloaks the politics underlying the scandal theyve accused house speaker tom craddick of stirring up the trouble his aides deny that and craddicks been quoted as saying he was surprised by the allegations the three democrats suggested some rule changes that would prevent parttimers from getting fulltime benefits theyd bar nonelected officials from receiving electedclass benefits some house and senate officers can under certain circumstances get the same retirement package thats open to elected officials they would allow members to hire oncall employees who wouldnt work fixed hours and would require monthly accounting of employee overtime vacation and sick leave and theyd prevent fulltime employees from holding outside jobs a shot at former state representative terry keel whos the house parliamentarian and who with permission from craddick has kept his outside law practice open representative byron cook one of the first house members accused of giving fulltime benefits to parttime employees named a house subcommittee to clarify the states employment laws and house rules for both employees of the house civil practices committee as well as all house capitol district and committee staff employees  cook chairman of the house committee on civil practices pegged the investigation to differences over a memo on the scandal from representative jessica farrar dhouston he says its accurate but said in a statementthat aides to house speaker tom craddick have called it incorrect the subcommittee he named will attempt to find out whats right and whats wrong and go from there representative mark strama daustin will chair that group joined by representatives phil king rweatherford richard raymond dlaredo and robert talton rpasadena craddick had askedphillips to investigate the issue some members of cooks committee wanted to leave it there but he wouldnt recognize their challenges instead forming his new subcommittee and then moving on to other business cooks new panel hasnt met when phillips dropped out cook said he was inclined to forge ahead but hadnt decided a carrollton legislator wants the names of former legislators now working as regular state employees and adding time to the topdrawer retirement accounts set up for all of the states elected officials representative jim jackson a republican asked the employees retirement system for records of all former state elected officials past and present who after leaving office were listed as fulltime employees with any state agency that makes them eligible to participate in the employee class of ers  he also asked for salary information and whether theyve transferred time earned as regular employees to their elected class accounts jackson said in his letter that the preferential treatment of former members of the elected class is unnerving a reference to the state law that allows them to transfer their work time into the more lucrative elected class accounts he wrote that he was particularly incensed about oncall employees who dont have set hours but get time on the state payroll that adds to their retirement benefits we recently looked at the state pension plans brochures and an employees full or parttime status has nothing to do with whether and how they accrue time for pensions to get credit for a months work you need only be on the payroll on the particular day in that month when the checks are cut and allow the pension deduction to come out of your check the difference between elected class and employee class for most people is in the base salary thats used to compute benefits for state employees that base is the average of their three highestsalary years for elected officials its keyed to the pay of state district judges currently 125000 state employees who make more than that actually do better than retired officeholders but most make much less and also have to wait longer or work longer to collect the benefits officeholders can retire at age 60 if they served for eight years and at age 50 if they served for 12 or more state employees can retire when their combined age and years of employment reach 80 heres a quick and almost certainly incomplete list of former elected state officials who currently or recently have been on the state payroll as regular full or parttime employees from statewide office former railroad commissioner charles matthews from the state senate ken armbrister chet brooks and kent hance from the house ben campbell terry keel mike mckinney terral smith miguel wise and zeb zbranek matthews was the only one in that bunch whos elected state position was a fulltime job texas legislators are parttimers and get better benefits than the fulltimers who work for them one more note former county officials like jackson can transfer their county time into the state system or viceversa state auditor john keel says he has not been asked to look at the house employment mess and isnt conducting an audit of the payroll system there the state auditors office has been mentioned in some stories here and elsewhere as a possible investigator along with travis county prosecutors various house committees and the attorney general keel says they havent seen any such requests on paper or otherwise theyre not involved one problem with an audit of legislative records is that some possibly critical pieces of paper just dont exist its a faithbased accounting system lawmakers sign up their employees and say whether theyre full or part time and what their pay should be but the house doesnt require time sheets or any other proof of the hours that were actually worked that makes it more difficult to prove that someone worked say 40 hours a week ultimately its an honor system that sort of hole in the paper trail can make it hard to tell the difference between a cheater and someone who follows the rules in political terms thats a mess how do representatives seeking reelection prove their house employees really work the hours for which theyre paid while legislators battle over whats fair to them a lot of their employees get hosed texas lawmakers already get far more than fulltime work from many of their employees and theyre largely exempted from laws guaranteeing overtime pay and comp time for the long hours their staffs put in during legislative sessions and when interim committees are cranking out reports if you did a proper accounting of the time the nonelected people actually work in the pink building youd have to bring sacks of money for overtime or get used to empty halls after sessions when staffers traded hours off for extra hours worked as it stands overtime for legislative staffers is rare and whether employees get any time off for the extra hours is like the time sheets and everything else up to the individual legislators on the eve of a court fight representative nathan macias has decided to concede to doug miller who beat him by 17 votes in the republican primary macias sued for a recount after the republican party of texas and the secretary of state signed off on the votes and was supposed to go to trial for an election contest on monday but on friday afternoon he issued a statement saying hes giving up and taking some last swipes on the way out it was a long list in his statement the whole thing is here he indicated hes out of money he mentioned his failed attempt to replace the judge in the case but also referred to some disturbing interaction between that judge and lawyers on the other side of the case that was never mentioned in his attempt to get another judge he said the attorney general is conducting an ongoing criminal investigation of the election he complained of campaign attacks by a progambling pac called texans for economic development he griped about coverage from local and regional media he said conservatives who ditched the gop primary to vote in the democratic contest for president hurt his chances he thanked the voters who legally participated in the election add chris bell to your list of candidates who might show up in the special election to replace retiring senator kyle janek rhouston later this year the houston democrat a former congressman and city councilman says hes been getting a lot of calls encouraging him to run two and maybe three republicans are in the hunt janek is backing austen furse whos raising money and actively campaigning and grant harpold a houston attorney and gop precinct chair has announced his candidacy former harris county gop chairman gary polland has talked about it but hasnt announced his plans janek plans to retire on june 2 and unless governor rick perry declares an emergency election janeks successor will be chosen in a special election on november 4  the same day as the general election that timing forces current house members to choose between running for reelection and running for the senate two of them  republican charlie howard of sugar land and democrat scott hochberg of houston  have expressed an interest in running howard says he wont run if he has to forfeit the house seat hochberg says he wont make a decision until he knows what perry plans to do bell meanwhile is getting calls the austin americanstatesman got the first bead on the story with an interview of senator kirk watson daustin who said hes among the people trying to talk bell into the race watson lost a statewide race before turning to the state senate bell who finished second in the 2006 race for governor would be in similar straits its republican turf but not prohibitively so statewide republican candidates won in sd17 but by slightly smaller margins than they won statewide the texas weekly index there is 154 meaning that the average statewide republican beat the average statewide democrat by that many points in the last two election cycles thats a republican lean but its still competitive particularly if its a bad year for the gop and some polling from the district  done by some of the people trying to draw bell into the contest  hints that it might be a bad year with 63 percent saying the country is on the wrong track and 53 percent giving george w bush a negative job rating bell whos been thinking about running for us senate if and when kay bailey hutchison gives up that post admits hes mulling a change in direction he hasnt made up his mind yet but says running the state race doesnt necessarily take him out of contention if the federal seat opens up hutchisons current term is over in 2010 and theres been speculation  add three paragraphs of caveats and provisos here  that shell resign early to focus on a run for governor the texas senate currently has 20 republicans and 11 democrats janeks seat is one of three where the hackocracy expects competition the others sd10 in fort worth where republican kim brimer will face

primaries hillary clinton leads barack obama in texas by eight percentage points and john mccain leads mike huckabee here by four  a statistical tie  according to polling done for the texas credit union league the gop race is in a statistical tie between mccain at 45 and huckabee at 41 texas congressman ron paul was the favorite of 6 in the democratic primary clinton with 49 leads obama with 41 clinton has to attract attention from people who dont usually vote in primaries while obamas first job will be to get the attention of the voters who usually do said david beattie president of hamilton campaigns democratic primary voters are more familiar with her he said while obama has a job of persuading those who are undecided or with her to come to his side thats a flip of whats happened elsewhere he has some voters who dont know him beattie said everybody knows her its a flip of iowa he wants to convince voters and she wants to bring in new voters  that said he expects the democratic primary to swell by 40 to 80 over normal primary levels as it has in other states during this contest he expects hispanic voters  a key constituency for clinton in texas  to make up about 30 percent of the primary vote africanamerican voters  a key for obama here and elsewhere  make up about 18 percent in his turnout model anglos made up 50 of the democratic respondents and 94 of the republicans surveyed and both beattie and his republican counterpart glen bolger a partner with public opinion strategies expect to see some republicans deciding to cross over and vote in the democratic primary mostly to oppose clinton the main difference between this and past texas primaries though is the obvious one the races arent over theres a reason to vote bolger said huckabee is holding onto social and religious conservatives and other hardcore republicans as he has in other states mccain is doing best with moderate and female republicans bolger sees the stakes as relatively low on the republican side since texas delegates arent portioned on a winnertakeall basis mccain can play for a tie and put it away elsewhere he said beattie the democrat says the republican numbers are interesting because theres still a tie you have a republican nominee that has the nomination all but locked up but is still working to get voters its not the coalescing that you want to see  both pollsters found an absence of animosity among voters about their own candidates each of the four leaders have approval ratings above 70 percent from their primary voters clintons voters like obama and viceversa mccains like huckabee and his like mccain they just prefer their choice over the other candidate with the exception of the relatively small group of republicans wholl cross the line to vote against clinton most of those polled are voting for someone and not against someone oh and both say they expect the electorate to move around  a lot maybe  as the four candidates campaign in texas i think youre going to have a very interesting couple of weeks beattie said the texas credit union league hired a democratic and a republican polling firm to run simultaneous surveys of texas voters earlier this week february 1113 for the democrats it was hamilton campaigns for the republicans public opinion strategies they each surveyed 400 primary voters  democrats and republicans respectively each survey has a margin of error of  49 percent some highlights of the tcul poll  top national issues for gop voters are illegal immigration terrorism and national security and the economy and jobs for democrats the top three issues are the economy and jobs the situation in iraq and health care  top state issues for republicans are illegal immigration property taxes and education the state issue lineup for democrats is education health care and illegal immigration  mccain leads 4936 with voters who plan to vote early huckabee has a 4542 edge with voters who plan to wait until election day on march 4 mccains strongest support comes from moderateliberal republicans and anglo women huckabees top groups are anglo men without college degrees very conservative and strong gop and religious conservatives  huckabee does best in east and west texas mccain in south central and the dfw areas  on the democratic side obama is the 4642 favorite with voters who plan to vote early while clinton leads 5140 with those who plan to wait until election day  clinton is strongest with hispanics and older and anglo women obama is strongest with africanamericans independents and men with college degrees  clintons strengths are in south and west texas and narrowly in east texas obama does best in central texas and houston and the candidates are locked in a tie in the dfw area  most of the democratic voters  85  say the countrys on the wrong track republicans split on that question with 46 saying the country is on the right track and 45 saying its on the wrong track  huckabee outdoes mccain with voters whose most important issues are terrorism and national security and illegal immigration mccain beats huckabee with those who think the economy and jobs are the most important issues huckabees voters say he shares their values mccains are split evenly across four areas experience values electability and is best able to deal with terrorism and the war in iraq  clintons better off with voters who have the economy and jobs and those concerned with iraq voters with health care at the top of their issue list favor obama those looking for experience like clinton those who want change prefer him  just over twothirds of the gop voters say they approve or strongly approve of the job george w bush is doing as president democrats werent asked that question the gop voters were also asked about their state officeholders us senator kay bailey hutchison is known by virtually all of those voters and has favorable or strongly favorable ratings from 87 of them the states junior senator john cornyn is known by 85 and viewed favorably by 60 governor rick perry is known to virtually all and gets favorable ratings from 62 lieutenant governor david dewhurst name identification 90 favorables 52 attorney general greg abbott name id 73 favorable 40 and comptroller susan combs id 64 favorables 29  and one for the sponsors of the poll texas voters apparently like credit unions more

clinton and barack obama are running regular television and both have spanishlanguage ads running on texas radio stations  put us senator kay bailey hutchison on the john mccain bandwagon  state senator kirk watson daustin endorses obama so does state representative pete gallego dalpine add state representatives trey martinez fischer dsan antonio and ana hernandez dhouston to the list of obama endorsers and us representative charlie gonzalez dsan antonio and representative jim dunnam of waco leader of the house democratic caucus  add former us representative charlie stenholm dabilene

endorsement wouldnt interfere with that gig it doesnt and shes with hillary  van de puttes former mayor ed garza of san antonio will be on the other side he endorsed obama  us representative and presidential candidate ron paul plans to stop at the university of texas at austin in a week though hes said he needs to keep an eye on his reelection bid hes also trolling for votes for the national office organizers are trying to attract 10000 people for a saturday event  new jersey barack obamas campaign says newark mayor cory booker will head the candidates efforts in austin texas hell open

cofounder dolores huerta whos from california the republicans of cd22 agree on one thing  one of them should oust democratic congressman nick lampson theyre battling over who gets to try voters have their choice of ten republicans in the primary the district has a republican history in past elections and the crowded field is a measure of the gops feeling that this seat is rightly theirs former us house majority leader tom delay held the seat for 22 years lampson the only democrat in this years race won in 2006 after delay resigned with the number of challengers there is a high chance of a runoff no ones going to walk away with this on march 4th says candidate pete olson his says his campaign has the financial resources  just over 400000  to be one of the two who makes the runoff i wouldnt trade our position with anybody olson says of his campaign olson was an assistant to former senator phil gramm and chief of staff for senator john cornyn and both have endorsed him along with bigname support olsons the only candidate with a myspace page for what thats worth his heroes it says there include his parents and the founding fathers not everyone seems too bothered by having nine opponents but ten is definitely a crowd it would be easier to focus on one or two opponents says jim squier a longtime harris county district court judge i think its great because it gives the people in 22 a choice says candidate shelley sekula gibbs shes leads the money race with close to 900000  including almost 500000 she loaned her campaign the houston dermatologist served the last few weeks of delays term after governor rick perry called a special election in 2006 she was a writein candidate on the general election ballot that year and lost to lampson by about 10000 votes sekula gibbs contends she would be the incumbent if she hadnt been a writein depending on whether you count sekula gibbs short stint olsons the only one with washington experience that doesnt scare another candidate state representative robert talton of pasadena hes got about 200000 putting him in the ranks with the two former mayors john manlove of pasadena and dean hrbacek of sugar land people are looking for somebody who isnt washington as usual talton says you can see it in the presidential races they dont like the idea that washingtons trying to run everything  a houston political blogger who calls himself the anticorruption republican he asked us to leave his real name out because he works in city government says hes just happy to vote for someone other than delay i havent voted for the guy since 1996 people are excited for this election because they can actually vote for the republican  the candidates held a forum tuesday night it felt like a family reunion  with a couple of siblings having it out says candidate brian klock he says olson and hrbacek were the rowdy ones klocks a military man and says he doesnt want to be lumped in with the professional politicians kevyn bazzy is working the same game the former military intelligence officer says the people without a lot of experience are being catapulted this seat can be taken by someone like myself its one of those rare years in politics  some people say lampsons still got a shot republican candidate cynthia dunbar says he has a very strong base in the district  she says the other candidates probably believe whoever wins the primary wins in november and that shes the only candidate that can effectively run against lampson nick lampson is nobodys fool klock says anyone who thinks theyre getting through this with a layup is wrong  carol trujillo with the fort bend county democrats is more than happy to see a long list of republicans it shows they dont have a clear favorite its a good thing she says the day after he lampson was elected they were predicting his demise but he has been a representative to all the people of 22 not just the democrats  she says lampson is more visible than delay was hes raised just a little more than sekula gibbs but with no debt and hes got about 715000 in his campaign accounts compared to her 435000 this race has a lot of candidates and voters thinking and working pretty hard but some just find it all a little funny weve got a fiveonfive basketball team which works out well for me because i think im the tallest of the candidates says olson whos 63 fort bend county democrat ann harper says for a while we kept joking that it was snow white and the seven dwarves   by karie meltzer governor rick perry heads to el paso next week to endorse republican dee margo whos challenging incumbent republican pat haggerty in the primary its highly unusual for a governor or any statewide official to run against incumbents from their own party to say the least margo ran unsuccessfully for state senate two years ago but haggerty barely fended off a challenge that year and in that district margo showed well in his senate bid haggerty has started a tv ad partly in defense that features him and his mom eleanor who ends with a killer tag line aimed at margos recent move into hd78 she says margo was appointed by house speaker tom craddick the margo camp denies that and says the challenger moved into the district just for this race i have a carton of milk thats been in the district longer than he has   in the category of very local politics mike huckabee and hillary clinton were the favorite presidential candidates in the new boston straw poll followed by john mccain and barack obama your scores in raw votes huckabee 111 clinton 65 mccain 32 and obama 25 that straw poll  sponsored by the northeast texas towns chamber of commerce  had the states two democratic candidates for us senate tied with 63 votes each rick noriega and ray mcmurrey can take this to the bank though incumbent republican john cornyn got 60 votes the democratic tilt held in the us representative race with democrat glenn melancon getting 69 votes to republican us representative ralph halls 66 and democratic state representative stephen frost getting 147 votes against republican challenger george lavender who got 55  quico canseco  one of two republicans running for a shot at us representative ciro rodriguez dsan antonio  won an endorsement from texas right to life  bryan daniel one of four republicans seeking the gop nomination in hd52 currently held by representative mike krusee rround rock won an endorsement from the texas farm bureaus pac whassup with that hes a former usda appointee  the texas parent pac endorsed joe tison the former weatherford mayor whos challenging state representative phil king in the republican primary thats no surprise the group helped recruit tison  former representative todd hunter a democratturnedrepublican whos challenging representative juan garcia dcorpus will get an assist from two gop statewide officials land commissioner jerry patterson and railroad commissioner michael williams will appear at a fundraiser on the uss lexington next week governor rick perry is cutting a video for that deal promoting the challenger  jonathan sibley of waco picked up an endorsement from former lieutenant governor bill ratliff of mount pleasant thats not in the district but the campaign said ratliff likes sibleys positions on public education he was also a legislative colleague of former senator david sibley the candidates pop sibley the younger is running against representative charles doc anderson in the gop primary texas laws restricting outside meddling in elections for the speaker of the house are unconstitutional according to a federal lawsuit filed by an unlikely coalition of political righties and lefties they say the law designed to keep outsiders from spending money to influence those elections and to lobby and debate with house members who elect their leader every two years prevents texans from voicing their own opinions the law effectively blocks voters and groups from voicing their views on a major bit of legislative business who runs the show that the suit says is a violation of four rights protected in the us constitution speech association petition and equal protection theyre attacking whats known as the speaker statute and its provisions against spending money to aid or defeat the election of a speaker candidate or of spending more than 100 for the cost of correspondence for that purpose you dont generally find these groups on the same side of the table free market foundation american civil liberties union of texas texas eagle forum pac kelly shackleford and david broiles the two individuals are respectively the president and chief counsel of the free market foundation and the legal vice president of the aclu theyre suing the texas ethics commission its members and executive director and collin county district attorney john roach named because hes shacklefords home da and as representative of all of the states district and county prosecutors the law has apparently never been challenged or used to prosecute anyone in the course of the halfdozen races for speaker that have taken place while its been in effect even so the groups say the 35yearold law has a birth defect read literally they say it makes it a crime to spend even the smallest amount of money in an effort to affect a speakers race newspapers regularly rail for and against house speaker tom craddick and his reelection is a vividly argued matter on the internet but the groups say the law has a chilling effect because it hasnt been enforced doesnt mean it wont be said lisa graybill with the aclu she said its impossible to know who has remained silent for fear of violating the law shackleford didnt name names but said he knows of groups that want to jump into the speaker debate who have been advised against it by their lawyers they say the law prohibits anyone from spending any money to lobby for educate or campaign on the issue of how members should vote for speaker theyll ask us district judge sam sparks of austin for an injunction preventing its enforcement in the march 4 primaries and in the early voting leading up to election day a political action committee that bases its decision on support on who a candidate supports for speaker might be violating the states laws against legislative bribery according to the texas ethics commission the commission was answering a question about whether a pac can ask house candidates who they support for speaker and whether they can base their decisions about support and funding on those answers when we first wrote about it they were looking at a draft that allowed sort of an ask but dont tell policy but the commission revised that draft in their meeting this week you can read the whole draft here the summary follows placing a candidate on notice that a generalpurpose committee will base its decision on whether or not to support the candidate on the candidates responses to the specific questions listed above would constitute legislative bribery under section 302032 of the government code whether a candidate has been placed on such notice is a fact question and as we have stated in previous opinions an advisory opinion cannot resolve fact issues the legal value of an ethics advisory opinion is to provide a defense to prosecution for activities that in the opinion of the ethics commission are not in violation of the laws under the jurisdiction of the ethics commission we cannot provide that type of defense in this request because we cannot anticipate the different circumstances in which the specific questions listed above may be asked texans for public justice filed a criminal complaint against a political action committee and house speaker tom craddick monday saying theyre trying to buy the march elections a lawyer for craddick says theres nothing to it the complaint centers on contributions given by texas jobs  opportunity build a secure future to three democrats who have supported craddicks speakership in the past the pac got its biggest contribution  250000  from craddick and its sole beneficiaries as of the last reports were representatives kevin bailey of houston kino flores of palmview and aaron pea of edinburg each got 50000 from the pac the austin americanstatesman ran a story on representative dawnna dukes daustin last week quoting her saying she didnt take money from that pac because she didnt want the distraction of craddicks support and wanted to remain free to support any other speaker candidate tpj apparently took that to mean there were strings attached to craddicks proposal thus their complaint to travis county prosecutors their letter says craddicks a speaker candidate that the reelections of the three democrats would be valuable to his chances of reelection to that post and that his contributions are thus illegal under the laws governing speaker elections district attorney ronnie earle is looking into it according to a written statement in order to determine whether there has been a violation of the texas speakers act it will be necessary to gather additional information the public integrity unit is in the process of gathering such information and steps are being taken to secure relevant documents  roy minton craddicks lawyer says theres no substance to the complaint theyre trying to say this is a contribution to the speakers race and it aint he says its just not there  according to minton craddick contributed to the pac but didnt make the decisions on where its contributions should go either way he sees no foul play a georgia doctor sued by a fort worth optometrist says the settlement terms were different from what we were told and he says the original demand for libel damages from a chatroom posting  stated in a letter from a lawyer whos also a legislative honcho  was for 1 million tom annunziato a republican running against representative charlie geren rfort worth sued dr richard schulze jr and two others for libel a couple of years ago for comments they posted on a private internet chat room after seeing a picture of annunziato  whos not a medical doctor  in surgical garb see our original story on the lawsuits the first filings in those suits  annunziatos lawyer was representative phil king rweatherford  asked for 75000 in damages from each doctor and both annunziato and king told us the doctors settled the suits by paying kings fees and apologizing for their remarks but schulze says in a letter to us that the initial demands were higher than that the settlements lower he also raises some questions about where the case was tried though his lawyer said in our earlier story that the judge they got was fair king and annunziato

Spelling R.e.l.i.e.f.	2006-04-24	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2006/04/24/spelling-relief/	en	so heres a question does the huge budget surplus make it harder or easier to pass the governors proposed tax bill comptroller carole keeton strayhorn added 39 billion to the 43 billion that was already in the surplus  and those numbers dont include about 1 billion thats already in the states rainy day fund legislators generally dont approve new taxes except in times of fiscal crisis if youre inclined to stick with historical examples youll probably conclude the flood of cash will wash away chances for a new business tax that would be used to offset cuts in local school property taxes thats getting a boost from conservatives and conservative groups outside the capitol who view the surplus as money that ought to be refunded to taxpayers but 82 billion is enough money  if youre of another mindset  to bribe lawmakers to do almost anything were using the word bribe to mean an inducement thats not of interest to prosecutors its enough money to pay for a substantial teacher pay raise for instance increasing teacher pay is a big deal for a lot of lawmakers from both parties including some democrats who arent inclined to help governor rick perry and the republicans do a finance deal that doesnt include new money for schools house leaders are making their first run at this without sweeteners governor rick perry has said he might add new items to the special session agenda if lawmakers solve the courts problems with school finance that could come in one bill  a measure that lowers school taxes by 17 cents using money from the state surplus tax bills would come next if lawmakers think they need to do more some argue that a 17cent cut would satisfy court orders to give school districts meaningful discretion over their tax rates and that the lege could do that one bill and quit house speaker tom craddick says youll see tax bills on the floor of the house early next week starting with that tax cut funded solely by the states huge budget surplus and while this sounds a little contradictory he also says hell support perrys tax proposal the first bill on the floor would lower school property taxes by 17 cents funded with the budget surplus thats the idea thats been touted for weeks by representative warren chisum rpampa he says his bill would lower taxes enough to satisfy the courts while spending just little enough  about 237 billion  to avoid hitting a cap on growth in state spending and when thats done he says he like craddick will vote for the perry plan next comes a handful of singleshot tax bills each addressing a piece of the tax proposal forwarded by perrys texas tax reform commission one would raise cigarette taxes by 1 per pack another requires people selling and buying used cars to use bluebook values for tax purposes replacing something now known as the liars affidavit where they simply sign a form noting the price the big one would replace the current corporate franchise tax with a new tax on adjusted gross receipts putting the taxes in singleshot bills limits what can happen to them if they make it all the way to the senate a tax bill with three taxes in it is classified as a general tax bill and it can be amended with any other tax  even one not included in the original bill the senate could take a bill like that and send back a completely different tax bill and still be operating within the rules but a bill with only one tax included is only open to that one tax the senate could change the rate or any other aspect of it but they wouldnt be able to jump in with another levy perry didnt include anything but school finance in the official agenda for the legislative session but craddick and lieutenant governor david dewhurst have been meeting to work on an education reform bill that includes the reforms the two houses had in common theres already some argument about what ought to be in there but this is the texas legislature right the tax apple has at least two big worms in it one named robin hood and one that could keep the local school taxes from being cut to 1 as it stands the tax package in the house lowers school taxes without touching school finance formulas and without leveling out what schools can raise in local enrichment taxes if taxes are lowered to 133 and districts are allowed to raise rates a bit to get some local projects going the amount of money raised with a onecent tax increase varies widely from district to district a situation that sets off alarms with poorer schools education groups and others the center for public policy priorities did an analysis the average district gets 2714 per student for every penny increase in taxes a really wealthy district  highland park isd  can raise 127 per student with a 1cent tax increase they get more for their schools and dont have to recapture any of that money to share with poorer districts leveling things out the rich districts like it but its a dealbreaker for everybody else next is a bug in the way the legislation dedicates revenue from new taxes to property tax relief it puts it in a separate account but doesnt add in any other funds but the new taxes dont cover all of the costs of the lower property taxes in the first year the perrysharp plan requires 14 billion in money from the surplus strayhorn contends that gap grows every year sharp says economic growth will cover it but the school finance package doesnt force legislators to close the gap if it exists that 14 billion could go missing in the first round meaning what started as a 1 target tax rate could end up at 110 or 115 nothing in the bill forces lawmakers to contribute more than is raised by the new taxes the first fight in the tax debate will be over the rules of the fight the house calendars committee has asked members about a number of possibilities that would limit the debate on school finance they hadnt voted on one when we went to press but the pink building was buzzing with plots and counterplots the polling sheet used to test support for various rules  and tax plans  had several proposed limits  forcing tax amendments to be revenue neutral an idea stolen from budget debates where amendments that increase spending without cutting a like or greater amount are often prohibited  one that would require all amendments to stick to the property taxes line amendments spending money on anything else in other words would be disqualified democrats who are pushing a package of education measures including teacher pay raises health insurance and funding for textbooks are miffed about the possible restrictions but calendar rules cant take effect without approval from the full house expect that vote to get spun as the pro or antieducation vote particularly if the house approves a limiting rule this isnt just a democrats thing  though thats whos pushing in the house lieutenant governor david dewhurst is running tv spots promoting a bunch of stuff  teacher pay raises and health insurance and textbooks for instance  that wouldnt be allowed under the proposed house rules you can argue that same point the other way governor rick perry left everything but property taxes and school finance out of the official agenda for the legislature and adding them to the bills would flout the guvs instructions members were also polled we saw the questions but not the answers on their support for  17 cents in school property tax cuts funded with the budget surplus  prevention of appraisal tax creep  when property taxes increase not because rates went up but because property values rose  dedicating all new revenues  presumably from the new tax bill  to property tax relief and not to spending on education or anything else  the three major taxes the governor wants to create or increase a levy on adjusted gross receipts of companies an end to the liars affidavit that lets car buyers and sellers to understate sales prices and increases in cigarette taxes a spokesman for house speaker tom craddick asked about the proposed calendar rules said they hadnt been voted on yet and said his office didnt know what the committee would be considering or what had been proposed lawmakers looking for a way to cut school property taxes got a gift from comptroller carole keeton strayhorn on the first day of their special session they can spend 82 billion without new taxes theres even more if you count the 1 billion balance in the states rainy day fund and strayhorn whos also running for governor not that that has anything to do with it says the state could raise up to 77 billion more for education and other state programs with a combination of relatively small taxes video lotteries at race tracks and reinstatement of a government efficiency program in her office governor rick perry wants lawmakers to approve a new 59 billion tax on businesses that would replace the current corporate franchise tax and generate 4 billion or so in new money that new money would be used to cut local school property taxes by up to 50 cents over the next two years he suggested some of the strayhorn money could finance even bigger school tax cuts the gross receipts tax worked up by a 24member commission  headed by former comptroller and perry rival john sharp  has survived in the open field for weeks without a fatal blow thats some sort of a record for a tax bill and some businesses have gone past neutrality on the thing and said theyll actively support it weirder still lawmakers have held their cards close however and its not clear how that big money will affect the debate outside groups fired up websites and demonstrations to push against any new taxes they want the legislature to work with the surplus and go home you can see some of their handiwork on websites like wwwbigpileofmoneycom wwwtexansforlimitedgovernmentcom and wwwtexasfornonewtaxescom that was enough of a problem a week ago when the budget surplus was  officially anyhow  only 43 billion strayhorn citing growth in the economy a boom in taxable sales and in taxable energy prices added 39 billion to that number you can get a copy of her revenue estimate on the comptrollers website but the short version is that she added 17 billion to her estimate for sales tax revenues 719 million to her estimate on franchise taxes and 25 billion to what she thinks will come into state coffers as a result of high oil and gas prices and the taxes based on them strayhorn didnt come out and say lawmakers ought to use the surplus on school finance  she listed some suggestions she says would raise 77 billion every two years but she said they dont need a new business tax like the one the governor is proposing shed use some of the surplus but would increase the amount going into the states rainy day fund to 24 billion using all of the surplus she said would set the table for a massive tax increase later she agreed with perry and others that lowering local school property taxes would keep the courts at bay in the short term but still wants a 4000 acrosstheboard pay raise for teachers as part of a 17 billion annual increase in spending she would add to the states education budget she continued her assault  begun last week  on perrys business tax she says it runs up a deficit since it relies on the budget surplus in the first year and then correct that imbalance in later years when there might or might not be extra money sharp contends growth in the state economy will fill the gap the comptroller and the governor disagree on how to pay for cuts in local school property taxes in the years to come hed do it with a new business tax an increase in the tax on smokes and by using some of the state surplus comptroller carole keeton strayhorn would do it with efficient government legalized slot machines smoke taxes and revisions to the existing business tax neither included any changes to state sales taxes in their plans his has been out for weeks strayhorns list looks like this  strayhorn said budgeteers could get 3 billion if theyd reinstate the etexas program it was previously called the texas performance review thats like leaving a baby on the doorstep for the next comptroller strayhorn leaves office at the end of this year either to become governor or a retiree and her successor would be in the position of actually coming up with those dollars its possible but its not exactly ready to be counted  she reiterated her call for video lottery terminals at racetracks where voters have already approved gambling saying that would raise at least 2 billion every two years  perry and strayhorn agree on a 1perpack increase in cigarette taxes but not on how to use the money hed apply it to tax relief she wants the 14 billion to go to the health programs including the childrens health insurance program or chip  instead of a new business tax strayhorn wants to keep the current corporate franchise tax closing loopholes that allow businesses to avoid 1 billion in taxes every two years several independent numbercrunchers have said her numbers are conservative and that closing the socalled delaware sub and the geoffreys loopholes would bring in much more than that  she included a swipe at perry saying the state ought to save the 300 million now going into two funds used by the governor to spur economic development lieutenant governor david dewhurst launched a television ad campaign on school finance saying the state should use part of the surplus ought to lower local school property taxes give teachers a raise install some education reforms he says the state should close the loopholes in its business taxes governor perrys plan doesnt rate a mention you can watch the ad at this link  wwwtexasweeklycomdocumentsjoinwmv  or dig it out of our files section if you want to download a copy aides said the ads will run for at least two weeks and that they started in three markets austin dallasfort worth and houston san antonio is apparently going to be added later the ads are running on broadcast and cable channels and arent targeted just at republicans dewhurst bought cnn time as well as fox news if you take apart the content dewhurst doesnt sound far off the plans that comptroller carole keeton strayhorn laid out earlier in the week like her he wants a pay raise for teachers both would use part of the budget surplus both want to close loopholes in the existing business tax both want property tax relief that said hes putting more emphasis on education reforms and hes not on the gambling bandwagon shes driving what do the ads accomplish hard to say but they put dewhurst in the public eye pushing education and asking for a pay raise for teachers which could position him to take some credit  if theres credit to be had  when something finally passes and if the public feels prompted to phone in any requests of legislators the ads could drive that agenda possibly moving education reform or teacher pay raises higher on the list of legislative priorities lawmakers faced with a record state surplus and a governorbacked business tax also a record are now thinking about borrowing money to pay for state operations that would slow down the drop in cigarette sales and let the state enjoy the taxes a little longer it would also help the tobacco companies who would still lose customers to higher prices but more slowly than if the tax is raised by 1 per pack moments like this are why we have never turned our pens to fiction the governors tax reformers didnt buy the idea but the house ways  means committee approved a plan to cut a proposed cigarette tax in half to 50 cents and then to add on a nickel the 50 cents would go to property tax relief that nickel would be used to pay off new bonds and the money borrowed through those bonds would be used for property tax relief the rest of what started as a 1 tax would be phased in 25 cents at a time until the additional tax on smokes reached 105 the coalition for tobaccofree kids which has been lobbying for the 1 increase says a phasein would kill 9800 people  the number they figured would be saved from premature death if the prices went up more quickly and that many people quit by their math the higher prices would keep 20500 kids from taking up smoking  the texas medical association which was initially chilly about the tax plan endorsed it after the deal for doctors was sweetened doctors will be allowed to deduct an extra 50 cents for every dollar in medicaid and childrens health insurance program services they provide on the theory that they do that amount of charity medicine without getting paid  after thinking it over for a few days the leaders of a group promoting the perrysharp tax bill say theyll report the names of contributors to their group texans for taxpayer relief doesnt have to do that reporting under the law but say theyll do it anyhow they hope to raise as much as 6 million to run television radio and print ads pushing the new business tax now under legislative consideration perrys three gubernatorial opponents question whether the group is promoting his candidacy  not his tax bill  fun facts texas has 22490022 people according to the census bureaus 2004 estimate and the comptroller says the budget surplus  the amount of officially uncommitted money that will be available during the current twoyear budget cycle  is 82 billion thats 36164 for every human in the state  whatever you call that tax cooked up by perrys tax reformers its constitutional according to the attorney generals staff in a letter to perrys chief of staff first assistant attorney general barry mcbee perrys former chief of staff says the proposed tax isnt an income tax in particular he writes its not a tax on the income of the people in partnerships instead its a tax on the partnership which is legal taxing the individuals wouldnt be copacetic under whats known as the bullock amendment to the state constitution lame duck state senator frank madla dsan antonio wont serve out his full term but will be around for school finance in a letter to governor rick perry madla said he intends to resign may 31 the day before the courts say the school finance knot must be untangled madla who was seeking another term in the legislature lost the democratic primary to representative carlos uresti another san antonio democrat leaving seven months early probably wont cost his district a vote on school finance and frees madla to start collecting a legislative pension and starting something new from his resignation letter dated on the opening day of the special session it has been my greatest honor and pleasure to serve the citizens of this great state as both a member of the house of representatives and a state senator and making the decision to depart at this time was not easy however after many hours of thoughtful consideration and reflection i ultimately decided that after 33 years of prioritizing public service it was time to put my family first  tax bills and education reforms can induce ulcers in legislators who will soon face voters but some of the people in austin for the special session are at their last rodeo and could  theoretically anyway  relax five state senators and 19 members of the texas house are serving now but wont be back for more of this fun come january either because they gave up their seats or lost them three house seats already turned over in special elections to replace two republicans who resigned and joined the lobby  representatives ray allen of grand prairie and todd baxter of austin  and one democrat who died near the end of last years regular session joe moreno of houston and some number of current lawmakers dont know theyre almost finished the november elections are still ahead the first votes taken by their successors  in order republican kirk

the democratic primary for senate and glenn hegar rkaty won the gop nomination to succeed armbrister since the democrat dropped out after winning the primary hegar can safely measure the curtains for his new senate office those are the only guys on the list with a chance of returning to the legislature  albeit in another chamber  unless the unexpected happens in november us representative tom delay and two others wont face charges that they conspired to violate state election laws governing political contributions but other charges against the three men will proceed the states third court of appeals said the state legislature made conspiracy an offense in 2003 but that was after delay john colyandro and james ellis put together the operation that won a republican majority in the texas legislature in 2002 the 3rd court went along with state district judge pat priest whod tossed the conspiracy charge travis county district attorney ronnie earle appealed that and his appeal resulted in this new ruling hes still got the option to appeal to a higher court and said in a statement after the ruling that hes thinking about it prosecutors said conspiracy was already against the law in 2002 and that all the lege did the next year was make the law more clear the appeals judges seemed open to that argument but said in the ruling that theyre bound to follow a higher court precedent they even said more or less that they disagreed with the precedent but they followed it that sends the case back to priest unless earle decides to ask the texas court of criminal appeals for another shot in an email to reporters covering the case he said earle has 30 days to make that decision and that he himself will be on vacation in europe in june there are some benefits to being semiretired he wrote so the earliest hell be back on the case is probably around july 1 scott mcclellan spokesman for president george w bush and son of state comptroller carole keeton strayhorn is leaving his

A Dog's Breakfast	2006-03-13	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2006/03/13/a-dogs-breakfast/	en	maybe its a failure of imagination but we dont see an overarching narrative line in the results of this weeks primaries its like sitting with a palm reader who after five minutes of scrutiny looks up and says well this is interesting  when people look back on this one turnout might be the remarkable feature it stunk with some counts still out it appears the republicans attracted 661797 voters or 52 percent of those registered and the democrats attracted 522064 or 41 percent put it this way 9 of 10 registered voters is eligible to sign a petition for kinky friedman or carole keeton strayhorn  nobody in the states congressional delegation got beat us representative henry cuellar dlaredo comfortably beat former us representative ciro rodriguez dsan antonio getting almost 53 percent of the vote and former house majority leader tom delay rsugar land got 62 percent in the gop primary living to face democrat nick lampson in november in a race of national interest van taylor the richer of the two republicans seeking to challenge us representative chet edwards dwaco and the one with the iraq war on his resume won that primary with about 54 percent  six incumbent state legislators  a senator and five house members  lost their bids for reelection frank madla dsan antonio in incomplete returns managed only 431 percent against his challenger representative carlos uresti diane patrick rarlington beat house public education chairman kent grusendorf in a race seen in austin as a referendum on leadership plans for education truth be told its also a story as is the madla saga about an incumbent going unchallenged for a long time getting careless about his local politics and then getting up too slowly when serious competition finally arrived your previous case study two years ago was house appropriations chairman talmadge heflin rhouston two more incumbents from the dallas area are out though by possibly recountable margins jesse jones ddallas lost to barbara caraway by 68 votes and elvira reyna rmesquite lost to thomas latham by 64 votes  two of the socalled leininger five  roy blake jr of nacogdoches and carter casteel of new braunfels  lost to republican challengers former representative wayne christian rcenter beat blake with plenty of room to spare getting 562 percent nathan macias of bulverde had a 45vote margin over casteel out of 20307 votes cast thatll likely lead to a recount three others  charlie geren of fort worth 549 percent delwin jones of lubbock 602 percent and tommy merritt of longview 585 percent  won handily  therell be a runoff for us senate between barbara ann radnofsky who got 434 and gene kelly who got 374 she campaigned but didnt advertise much he did neither  chris bell is the democrats nominee for governor getting 637 of the vote and putting bob gammage to bed bell got 82 percent in harris county the place that sent both men to congress a couple of decades apart and he got 807 percent in fort bend county home of tom delay bells ethics complaint against delay in congress broke a longstanding truce

gubernatorial primary governor rick perry got 84 percent against three nonames  there will be a runoff for lite guv between maria luisa alvarado 399 and ben z grant 387 percent on the democratic side grant with less than 40 percent of the vote had the only nonhispanic name in that contest another fun fact the race for lieutenant governor got more votes on the democratic primary ballot than either the us senate race or the race for governor on the gop side lieutenant governor david dewhurst got 78 percent against tom kelly a political unknown and over there the governors race was the biggest vote attractor  in hd38 eddie lucio iii will apparently join his dad in the lege lucio the elder is in the senate the younger won the democratic primary for a house seat  in laredos hd42 richard raymond came up 38 votes from an outright win over three challengers including former webb county judge mercurio martinez who came in second  in hd146 representative al edwards dhouston came close to

rjacksonville got 54 in a fourman field in sd7 radio talk show host dan patrick rhouston got 69 in a wildly expensive fourway that included two state reps and a houston city councilman and in sd18 representative glenn hegar rkaty got 55 in his primary five senators and at least 17 house members will be in office for a special session this spring knowing they wont return for a regular session next january another three house members are in primary runoffs and will know on april 12th whether voters want them around after the end of the year with the exceptions of two house members who hope to be in the senate next year those legislators will be voting as if their political futures dont depend on it theyve got nothing to lose feeding speculation about the prospects for a tax bill and

their first bite at school finance kirk england rgrand prairie ana hernandez dhouston and donna howard daustin all three won special elections to replace members who died or resigned and then theres a group that wont be named until november members who will find out in the general election that they are currently serving their last term in the legislature but theyll be voting and behaving in a special session as if theyre coming back the free agents are the people wholl know during the special session that their days of political risk  and perhaps caution  are behind them even when there arent any notably expensive statewide races state races can be expensive even for losers we took some of the most competitive and expensive battles and charted the costs and the costs per vote one

didnt ask for the comptrollers blessing strayhorn the top vote getter of any gop candidate four years ago is running as an independent against governor rick perry who appointed jones to the rrc strayhorn wouldnt have endorsed jones if shed been asked as it turns out doing so in the view of strayhorns attorneys would have put her independent candidacy at risk like the voters who sign their petitions independent candidates disqualify themselves if they vote in primaries but for the candidates it goes further strayhorns camp interprets the law to say she cant take part in any activities of a political party endorsing their candidates voting in their primaries going to their functions you name it jones did her a favor by not asking for her support us representative tom delay rsugar land closed with an email to supporters telling them to turn out because democrats were seen earlyvoting in gop primaries and phone bank robocalls carried messages from delay himself from fort bend

reporters with the snarkiest parts of the gop dogfight highlighted in bright yellow  democratic gubernatorial candidate chris bell closed the austin part of his primary campaign with a sunday rally featuring an endorsement from senator gonzalo barrientos daustin the two wont serve together even if bell wins barrientos isnt seeking reelection  the loudest of the states senate primaries ended with senator frank madla dsan antonio debating an empty chair on television and with representative carlos urestis campaign advisors filing an ethics complaint against madla the tv debate was set up when uresti said hed joust anytime and anyplace he backed out but the show went on without him and madla got an open forum meanwhile the uresti camp complained to the local da that madlas campaign accounting didnt include all of the money it should have his numbers dont match those filed by texans for lawsuit reform according to the complaints the pac reported giving 655707 while madla reported receiving 36772 madlas camp says its a timing issue and that the numbers will match when the report dates synchronize somebody out on the internet sent a note to urestis campaign that was scribbled on the bottom of an email that appears to have come from helen madla the email urges people to vote on tuesday may 6th  the note scribbled at the bottom you should win your election representative uresti because senator madlas wife doesnt know when election day is  whatever the reason uresti ended with 569 percent to madlas 431 percent  governor rick perry hit three hot spots on election eve making campaign visits to representatives kent grusendorf rarlington vicki truitt rkeller and elvira reyna rmesquite truitt was the only winner in the bunch  diane patrick  the republican school board member

was one of grusendorfs themes and he got reinforcements tarrant county gop chair stephanie klick former chair steve hollern and former christian coalition chair scott fisher held an election eve presser to take his side patrick ended last week with an ethics complaint against grusendorf accusing him of passing out anonymous flyers those handouts were put on tables at a candidate forum and were targeted at those textbook votes by patrick the flyer included pictures of naked men according to the patrick camp grusendorf denied having anything to do with them and suggested the patrick campaign handed them out to generate a sympathetic backlash  martin rogoff one of the gop precinct chairs whose name was on a letter endorsing senate candidate dan patrick pulled his name and said hed be voting for representative joe nixon in that houstonarea contest representative corbin van arsdale sent out an email critical of patrick and his campaign van arsdale said hed been attacked for his support of nixon rogoff said he was joining van arsdale and didnt get a look at the endorsement letter that had his name on it he said he doesnt want to be associated with the tactics of the precinct chairs that are viciously supporting dan  nixons camp meanwhile said patrick listed the support of 117 gop precinct chairs in a recent mailer and adds that 29 of them arent actually precinct chairs patrick got 69 percent in a fourperson field that included him and three elected officials  first lady anita perry opened a getoutthevote email with a sure indication that the people in the governors mansion werent worried  while there arent any high profile statewide contests that are grabbing headlines there are still many races that are critical to the future of our great state  her husband governor rick perry had three primary opponents former governor ann richards asked her doctors about an odd feeling in her chest and after some tests found she has esophageal cancer shes seeing doctors at md anderson in houston for more testing diagnosis and treatment aides to carole keeton strayhorn aides say consultant george shipley isnt on the payroll yet but they expect him to be helping the campaign for those just tuning in that would mean that a republican state comptroller running as an independent has one of the states prominent democratic consultants among her advisors shipley has been an advisor to a long list of democrats over the years including ann richards bob bullock dan morales henry cisneros and judith zaffirini in recent years hes been working with the five

Tall Cotton	2006-03-06	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2006/03/06/tall-cotton/	en	back in the middle 1980s a dallas savings and loan tycoon who gave a lot to texas democrats said it was usually better to be the second or thirdbiggest political giver in any given election cycle since the guy giving the most took the shots in the papers but sometimes the guy you think is giving the most money is actually in second place dr james leininger of san antonio along with his wife cecilia leininger has been taking the shots in the papers but look over his shoulder homebuilder bob perry of houston along with his wife doylene perry has given 588000 so far this year according to the texas ethics commission and since july when the fundraising for the current political cycle was already well underway hes given 23 million add a little more if you count the money the perrys no kin to the governor have poured into texas politics since the regular legislative session ended last may youll get 317677950 the significance of that date most state officeholders are barred from raising money during regular legislative sessions and they end their sixmonth fast with a powerful hunger for campaign cash leininger by way of comparison has contributed 289781789 over that same period leiningers contributions this cycle have been concentrated with 18 million going to the texas republican legislative campaign committee and another 495000 going to the future of texas alliance the rest went to a variety of candidates and causes and committees including 106600 to governor rick perry 100000 each to lieutenant governor david dewhurst and to texans for marriage 65000 to the texas republican party and 50000 to attorney general greg abbott perry has a longer list of beneficiaries including 401000 to texans for lawsuit reform pac 320529 to abbott 210000 to dewhurst 205000 to governor perry 100000 to railroad commissioner michael williams whos not on the ballot 200000 each to ag commissioner susan combs whos running for comptroller and railroad commissioner elizabeth ames jones who is on the ballot 195000 to hillco pac 185000 to representative joe nixon rhouston whos running for state senate 150000 to texans for marriage 95000 to the texas republican party and 80000 to land commissioner jerry patterson unlike leininger perry has some democrats on the list of people he has supported in this cycle including representatives ana hernandez of houston 25000 norma chavez of el paso 10000 allan ritter of nederland 7000 harold dutton of houston 1000 ismael kino flores of palmview armando mando martinez of weslaco 1000 jose menendez of san antonio 1000 sylvester turner of houston 15000 mike villarreal of san antonio 1000 sens rodney ellis of houston 12500 frank madla of san antonio mario gallegos of houston 11000 juan chuy hinojosa of mcallen 2500 eddie lucio jr 15000 eddie lucio iii running for the house 10000 and john whitmire of houston 20000 the two big donors arent always on the same side leininger is the money behind wayne christians effort to regain his old house seat against roy blake jr  perrys with blake but leininger has four other republican primary races in particular in his gunsights and perrys with him in three of those supporting van wilson against representative delwin jones in lubbock mark williams against representative tommy merritt in longview and chris hatley against charlie geren in fort worth representative kent grusendorf rarlington is in the last week of the toughest race of his political life and he sounds remarkably like a man who has taken himself hostage we will pass legislation to fix school finance this spring or ill resign he told a group in arlington and then repeated for us and other newsies in a press release his own announcement calls that a rare and bold move and he says the texas supreme courts ruling on the case  which wasnt available to lawmakers who failed to solve the puzzle last year  will make the difference his whole quote for the last 19 years i have dedicated my career to improving the lives of texas children and today i am reaffirming my commitment and resolve to get the job done i am confident in my ability and the ability of the republican leadership in the house and senate to find common sense solutions build on the bipartisan sharp commissions recommendations and send a bill to governor perry he can sign with pride  play out the possibilities just for sport the winner of next weeks hd94 republican primary between grusendorf and diane patrick will face democrat david pillow in november thats a republican district but if grusendorfs the winner and school finance doesnt fly pillow could win the political lottery  representative charlie geren rfort worth is spending at least as much time running against one opponents financiers than against the opponent and hes gone negative on the money man in a story in the fort worth startelegram dr james leininger is a desperate old man a rich old man who wants to buy his way he wants people to whore for him and i wont do it district 99 is not for sale i think next week the voters will show dr leininger that  geren happily repeated the line a few days later when he learned that several republican colleagues in the house  linda harperbrown of irving bill keffer of dallas jodie laubenberg of parker bill zedler of arlington and mary denny of denton  were endorsing hatley id a whole lot rather have the endorsements of lieutenant governor david dewhurst house speaker tom craddick former lieutenant governor bill ratliff sens chris harris and kim brimer than a bunch of sophomores and mary denny whos not even running again  he singled out zedler who according to geren had said he wasnt getting involved in hatleys race hes lying just like they are  as for leininger geren said hes just digging himself a hole   van taylor a veteran who wants the gop nomination to run against us representative chet edwards took the gloves off after his opponent tucker anderson sent out mail pieces quoting a woman who said taylors longwindedness reminded her of a us senator from massachusetts that in taylors judgment opened the door for negative campaigning when my opponent called me john kerry i had to defend myself its an affront its low its dirty and its wrong  kirk england beat democrat katy hubener and libertarian gene freeman and will take the place of former representative ray allen rgrand prairie england lost the election day voting by 151 votes but came out of early voting with a 499vote margin that was plenty and the republican newcomer to politics is on his way to the statehouse the three will meet in the november general election with the winner getting a full term in the house england pulled in 529 percent of the 5274 votes cast in percentage terms thats close to what allen got against hubener two years ago when he won 526 percent of 35815 votes cast hubener ended up with 462 percent of the vote in 2004 running in the general election against allen she got 474 percent of the vote final campaign finance numbers spending especially arent in but hubener reported raising 110142 for the special election and spending 81245 england raised 147138 and spent 91383 those numbers include the reports filed eight days before the election and the beginning of year reports before that along with telegram reports on late contributions late spending isnt in there but based on those numbers and the unofficial vote totals hubener spent 3332 per vote and england spent 3277 per vote one oddment from the election numbers england won 259 of the 358 early mailin ballots thats 72 percent he got 58 percent of the early inperson vote on election day 47 percent former state representative glen maxey of austin will run for chairman of the texas democratic party hes been kicking tires up to this point but says in a letter to supporters and potential supporters that hes decided hell be one of the candidates at the state convention in june in fort worth maxey whose day job is political and policy consulting is one of the democratic partys best organizers but he hasnt been a prominent fundraiser this is where wed usually insert some of the arguments against him but he did it for us hitting on a couple of points wed been hearing from democrats who arent wild about his candidacy in his announcement letter im an openly gay man im not rich im not goodlooking and i hate cocktail parties  maxey says hed build up county chapters of the party bring more young people in and fortify the democrats thin infrastructure in texas charles soechting the current chairman wont seek reelection at least two others have said theyll probably run boyd richie of graham and charlie urbina jones of san antonio they are both attorneys  republicans havent firmed up a contest for chairman yet but tina benkiser the current occupant of the texas gops corner office has said shell seek reelection gina parker of waco who lost to benkiser last time has been raising her profile and former dallas county gop chairman nate crain whos been critical of the current team is considering a challenge when the state party convenes in san antonio also in june gubernatorial candidate carole keeton strayhorn is kicking sand at secretary of state roger williams and talking about suing the state in a dispute over when she can start collecting signatures for her independent bid for office her position  verified but then retracted by a lawyer with williams office  is that she can start collecting signatures after the polls close on election day the folks at sos say she cant do that until the next day strayhorn wanted to start grabbing signatures while party candidates are waiting to find out who won and lost she also wanted to punch the state  and williams an appointee of governor rick perry  for making it difficult to get on the ballot as an independent the laws governing this are rigged against independent candidates and have been for years to run for governor strayhorn and kinky friedman each have to collect 45540 signatures the signers have to be registered voters who dont vote in the primary or in any runoffs they have to sign a particular sort of form while a specifically qualified person watches and the whole operation has to be done between next week and may 11 theres more to it but you get the idea williams has said itll take his office two months to verify the signatures  making sure theyre from registered voters who didnt vote  and thats getting squawks from both of the independent camps  help from others delwin jones gets some mileage out of tv spots featuring senator robert duncan rlubbock talking on his behalf and against outside money in the race charlie geren rfort worth is getting similar help from us representative and former fort worth mayor kay granger whos endorsing him over chris hatley and colby brown tommy merritt another on the list of five incumbent republicans challenged by leiningerbacked candidates is relying on help from home his wife appears on his commercials decrying the ugly campaign against him and merritt topped it by filing a libelandslander suit to try to either slow his opponents attacks or turn voters his way governor rick perry did some traveling a week before the election to try to boost incumbents in challenge races he did pressers with representatives betty brown rterrell scott campbell rsan angelo dan flynn rvan charlie howard rsugar lane and larry phillips rsherman  democrat david van os whos running for attorney general plans to filibuster for independence for 24 hours at the state capitol hes invited other democratic candidates to help him talk starting at 6pm friday march 3  the texas freedom network says the states most active conservative pac might be operating illegally the group complained to state election officials that the texas republican legislative campaign committee has fewer than ten contributors  the minimum number required for a political action committee to operate in state elections that pac is funded almost entirely by dr james leininger of san antonio hes a proponent of using public money for private school vouchers tfn is on the other side of that fight theyve also complained that another committee  the all children matter pac  didnt properly report its fundraising and spending that pac is spending money it never reported raising or having available to spend as we noted here last week behind all the election noise that business about taxes and school finance is still rumbling along and its not a smooth ride there is nothing like the prospect of a tax vote in an election year to get lawmakers and taxpayers twitching the state has a surplus and some lawmakers want to use that 43 billion as a temporary fix for school finance  a solution that would make for a short and sweet special session this spring followed by a regular session next year that starts with the need for a 6 billion tax bill that idea is appealing to legislators who face opponents in november because it means they wouldnt have to make any politically hazardous votes on taxes between now and then it also would make for a quick session  and after two special sessions last summer lawmakers dont relish the thought of a draggedout fight in austin former comptroller john sharp enlisted by the governor to come up with a state tax that would replace part of those local property taxes is trying to keep the tax fix alive he and governor rick perry have been visiting with small groups of legislators and sharp is trying to enlist the support of business groups and trade associations we caught him at the texas motor transport associations meeting but weve asked around and its pretty much the same version other groups are getting if you listen carefully to his pitch you can detect some of the political trouble spots that have come up in the sessions with lawmakers and tax policy types the state has to pay a bigger share of public school costs to lower pressure on local school property taxes so districts can lower those rates and the texas supreme court will settle down the current rig the court says is unconstitutional perry and other state leaders want to broaden the states tax on businesses and to lower local property taxes by the same amount so they can fix this and still say with straight faces they didnt raise taxes thatll be true on average but it also means some texas businesses will be paying a new tax with no obvious benefit to anyone but state government current taxpayers would get a break at the expense of new taxpayers the legislators who have to vote on the thing want to know that those new taxpayers wont have a bad reaction sharp wants to replace the state franchise tax with a tax on business receipts companies would take their gross receipts deduct their choice of cost of goods sold or payroll and benefits and then pay a one percent tax on whats left thats the gist of it the actual mileage will vary as they fiddle with definitions and such the pitch from sharp and the tax reform panel hes heading starts with the things that cant be done bigger homestead exemptions wouldnt satisfy the court wiping out property tax exemptions already on the books would hurt economic development raising sales taxes would put the state on the high end of consumption taxes among the states and could hurt bidness though hes not saying it would be on the agenda this spring hes not saying otherwise either sharp says the state needs to make increases in property taxes more difficult so that local governments cant hide rate increases behind increases in property values waiting until the regular session he warns would put all the bargaining chips back on the table school finance would get lost in a fight between lawmakers who want more money for schools he says and those who want education reform first thats his argument for a spring fix when the governor can limit whats on the agenda for consideration catch the trouble spots theres a faction that wants to raise sales taxes theres a group of lawmakers that wants to put a permanent fix off for a year theres a group that wants property tax reform theres a group that wants homestead exemptions and there are groups that dont want to do anything with taxes unless they can get education reform or more money for schools  or both  in the bargain house speaker tom craddick named representatives rafael anchia ddallas

Dirty Words	2006-02-06	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2006/02/06/dirty-words/	en	some things in government as at the pharmacy are contraindicated for instance you can say income or payroll or gross receipts but you cant use any of those terms in close proximity to the word tax just look at what happened to john sharp head of the governors tax reform panel who had to back out of too close an encounter between tax and gross receipts in his comments after a speech to a trade group sharp sent an email to reporters after the first couple of stories just to make sure they didnt put all those dangerous things too close to each other that particular option can no more be called a gross receipts tax than a sales tax can be called an income tax he wrote although they use similar basis a gross receipts tax to business connotes a tax on the entire gross receipts of a company that is far from the case with this option it is accurate at this stage to say it is a revision of the states franchise tax and some people have referred to it as a tax dealing with margins but it is not and never will be a gross receipts tax  the next days headline in the houston chronicle indicated there might still be a problem commissions chief backs gross receipts tax  something similar happened to lawmakers who devised the current corporate franchise tax in 1991 its based partly on earned surplus a term that corresponds to a word in our own language income republicans called it an income tax but it passed and has never been successfully attacked in court a tax on gross receipts isnt illegal but might as well be it wouldnt pass political muster whatever they finally call it the scheme sharp and his committee are talking about is one we outlined broadly back before christmas advisory commissions like this one dont have to post their meetings or even allow the public to watch but theyve been working behind the scenes on ways to raise enough state money to finance a cut in local school property taxes they want 55 billion to 6 billion which would knock as much as 50 cents off of local taxes in what looks like their favorite proposal of the moment a company would start with its gross receipts it would have the choice of subtracting costs of goods sold or its payroll and benefits and it would pay a one percent tax on whats left capitalintensive companies would probably opt to subtract the costs of the things theyre selling so they wouldnt pay taxes on car parts or computer parts or whatever theyre making laborintensive outfits where people are the highest cost items would subtract payroll and benefits companies would be allowed to apportion their revenues and costs so they wouldnt be paying state taxes on business thats done elsewhere theyre still fiddling with the details talking to big taxpayers key legislators and anyone whose opposition could feasibly break the deal but some details are ripening sole proprietorships probably wouldnt be included in the new tax base since there is almost no way to tax them without violating the states ban on personal income taxes taxes would be aimed away from partners and toward their partnerships to avoid similar problems small businesses  those with gross receipts of less than 300000  probably would pay no tax at all there would probably be a cap on the amount of income for one person that a company is allowed to subtract from gross receipts some of the discussions have put that at 300000 people could still have higher salaries than that but the higher amounts wouldnt be deducted from a companys tax base state leaders near and far from that panel are also talking about putting more money into education but theyre playing with the wording they want to limit the number of things that can go wrong in a special session by ignoring whats not absolutely needed but they have to have enough sweeteners in the package to attract enough votes to get a solution through both houses the state has 3 billion to 4 billion in the till  money that wasnt budgeted and money thats pouring in unexpectedly because of things like high oil prices some of that could be spent on education without raising state taxes above whats needed to replace local tax cuts those who feel the need would get to call the tax plan a shift instead of an increase those who want more money in the schools would have cover too republicans who want education reform in return for new money might be convinced to wait for the regular session and democrats who want more money into the schools would have to wait to get a permanent fix the states solicitor general says there are five ways to get the texas supreme court out of the school finance business ted cruz  who argued the school finance case in court  is telling lawmakers and tax panels and anyone who wants to know just whatll get the judges out of the school finance business what he says is important because it rules out other arguments once lawmakers pick from cruzs list theyll have four fewer things over which to disagree 1 a constitutional amendment allowing a statewide property tax cruz says that would be the easiest and simplest legal way out of the court case when he told a senate about it recently he added that he wasnt talking about politics and popularity just law 2 a reform in the state system that ends reliance on property taxes the legal trouble is that the courts think the state is forcing school districts to set property tax rates at or near a particular rate thats an illegal state property tax taking property taxes out of the system might create other problems but it would solve this one 3 raise the states cap on local property taxes that would make the legal claims disappear at least for a while several lawmakers point out that it would cause other disruptions in the school finance formulas but cruz is talking only about the current school finance case raising the cap by 15 or 20 cents  to 165 or 170  would kill the argument that the state has stolen meaningful discretion over tax rates from local officials 4 reduce the requirements the state puts on districts by lowering what theyre required to do and thus reducing the price of doing it and the pressure to set higher local property tax rates we understood it this way if you want to buy a car and you dont want to spend more money you have to settle for less car 5 give the districts more money without lowering the state cap on property taxes this appears to be the most likely political solution if lawmakers can agree on a big new business tax and to use the money to raise state spending on schools and to ease pressure on local school spending school districts will regain their discretion over property tax rates cruz and other state lawyers say the states probably on safe ground if most districts have tax rates 20 cents or so below a state property tax cap state leaders are starting to talk like theyre willing to limit whats up for discussion in a special session house speaker tom craddick said this week that education reforms could come up during a special session or later in next years regular session of the legislature up to now hes been saying education reform ought to be part of the package when school finance comes up senator florence shapiro rplano started off a session of her school finance committee by saying last years efforts failed because lawmakers tried to be too broad and tried to do too much  maybe theyll shrink the battlefield this time voters partaking of the special election to replace representativeturnedlobster ray allen rgrand prairie will see three names in the hat republican kirk england libertarian gene freeman and democrat katy hubener will all be on the ballot on february 28 edward smith whos still on the gop primary ballot didnt sign up for the special and england and hubener and freeman will go another round in november theres some question about whether voters will see smiths name when they vote in the gop primary in hd106 the address he listed when he signed up is represented by toby goodman rarlington and a dallas judge ordered him off the ballot but the gop still has him on their final list whether hes there or not hes ineligible for the post the special election arsenals start small england had 1550 in the bank at the first of the year and hubener had 8345 the texas ethics commission didnt list a report for freeman one of hubeners contributors for 1000 is representative lon burnam dfort worth the election is on february 28 and early voting starts february 13 in the runoff for hd48 in austin republicans are trying to doubledown and defeat democrat donna howard who surprised almost everybody by nearing winning outright in the first round as with the hd106 race the contestants will meet again in november for the benefit of the same voters republican ben bentzin is getting daily help from elected officials like susan combs and both she and john cornyn have signed off on written appeals on his behalf bentzin was already winning the finance war for what thats worth reports on file with the texas ethics commission have him spending 262708 getting his 5125 votes thats 5126vote while she spent 69982 getting 6705 votes 1043vote early voting starts february 6 dorothy olmos who lost in the first round of the special election to replace the late representative joe moreno turned up on the payroll of laura salinas who lost in the runoff to ana hernandez olmos and charles george were knocked out in the first round of that race both are running in the regular election as republicans though they were in the first round as democrats and both endorsed salinas in round two one of her expenses in that runoff was 1000 to olmos for field campaign work  one more item of note from salinas last report texans for lawsuit reform stayed with her to the tune of 20000 for the runoff but they werent the biggest contributor that designation falls on former state representative roman martinez of houston who contributed 6827813 his wife former representative diana davila martinez was salinas campaign treasurer salinas is her niece none of this will be on the test at the end of the semester the texas legislative council ignored noise from democrats and voted  with only one dissent and from a republican at that to make milton rister the new director of that agency two longserving legislators wrote to the committee and to house speaker tom craddick and lieutenant governor david dewhurst to back away from plans to hire rister  who made his name in republican electoral politics  as head of the nonpartisan and nonpolitical tlc its a legislative agency that does everything from bill drafting to computer tech work for lawmakers of both parties in both the house and the senate tlc went without a permanent director for two years but on the eve of the vote on a new director representatives paul moreno del paso and senfronia thompson dhouston said it wont do to have a legislative agency headed by a guy who spent the last 20 years trying to knock democrats out of the legislature but several lawmakers including a couple of democrats said they were satisfied that rister play fair and that hell stay out of politics while hes got this job and when it came time to vote all of the democrats and all but one of the republicans were with

their mistakes that effectively puts the two republican judges back on the ballot against keel francis didnt say in all of the right blanks on the form just which spot on the court he seeks to fill

High Overhead	2006-01-30	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2006/01/30/high-overhead/	en	sherry boyles a former statewide candidate and cofounder of a democratic pac that supports female candidates left that group earlier this month to pursue other opportunities shes leaving an organization that spent 81 percent of the money it raised in 2005 even though that was a political off year with only one election kelly white is the new chief at annies list a relatively young fundraising and political group that supports prochoice democrats running for state office the group was started by boyles who ran unsuccessfully for railroad commissioner in 2002 and former representative ann kitchen daustin kitchen and some of the original board members left in 2004 less than a year after the groups startup and boyles was in control until this month annies list spends more on administration and fundraising than on support for political candidates its stated purpose last year  an off year with only one election  the group spent more than 80 percent of the more than 325000 it raised the money went to salaries and other administrative expenses 115376 fundraising events 60823 catering and other food 29384 travel 23476 printing and photography 15363 office expenses 9470 and furniture and dcor 8753 politics ranked eighth in spending annies list gave 1000 to representative yvonne gonzalez toureilles ralice to help cover the costs of her election contest and they contributed 6000 to representative ana hernandez dhouston who won a special election to replace representative joe moreno who died in a highway accident last spring boyles was paid 81400 in consulting and management fees and bonuses and was reimbursed for over 2600 in travel and mileage expenses that was about 25 percent of what the pac collected from donors last year the 7000 that went to candidates was a relatively minor piece of the budget for annies list and accounted for slightly more than2 percent of what the group raised from political donors the pac raised 325293 in 2005 spent 270475 and ended the year with 61924 in the bank and with 5000 in outstanding loans boyles wasnt available for comment white whos replacing boyles was one of the groups top candidates in 2004 she lost a very close race to representative todd baxter raustin that year and briefly considered running in last tuesdays special election to replace him now that shes at annies list the group is endorsing donna howard in the runoff for that hd48 seat against republican ben bentzin white was howards campaign treasurer a position she gave up to take the job with annies list howard is now listed as the treasurer of her own campaign the organization had some successes in the 2004 cycle they backed two incumbentkillers for instance alma allen who knocked off ron wilson in the democratic primary and veronica gonzales who won a contested primary against roberto gutierrez and others and then won a close general election race white wont talk about happened before she took over but says she wants the group to spend its time and money on candidates and on campaign infrastructure like training political workers and block walkers and such to help inexperienced and understaffed campaigns her background is in the nonprofit world and she says shell model annies list on that sector with no more than 25 percent of whats raised going to administrative expenses had that been the case last year the pac would have entered 2006 with more than 200000 in its war chest theyre also encouraging donors to put up at least 100 for the group and to commit to another 200 in contributions to candidates that can be made later through the organization theyll collect checks from their donors  made out to candidates rather than the pac  and pass them along in bundles white is talking to other candidates around the state and says the group will soon make some endorsements for the regular primaries milton rister who has been a republican political consultant a state employee a candidate for office in two counties and a republican party official is the leading candidate to take the helm at the texas legislative council thats the state agency that drafts legislation for members of both parties and provides inhouse legal services on everything from redistricting to rule interpretations the post has been open for two years since steve collins left to join the legislative staff at the university of texas system collins predecessor was bob kelly who like collins didnt come from a background of partisan politics rister ran for county office in midland and got to know house speaker tom craddick there he moved to austin with the clayton williams campaign almost 17 years ago he was the treasurer and manager of craddicksponsored political action committees designed to take control of the texas house  76 in 96 eight in 98  and he was a research consultant to texans for a republican majority pac the free enterprise pac and the texans for lawsuit reform pac all of those were important in republican efforts to win a majority in the texas house and to elect a speaker an effort that finally paid off after the 2002 elections when a new gop majority elected craddick speaker rister helped draw the political district maps used in that election and helped again when republicans drew congressional maps to take over the states delegation to washington dc he worked for lieutenant governor david dewhurst as head of senate research  a job he left for six months in 2004 to serve as executive director of the state gop democratic legislators are antsy about the selection lege council has traditionally been a keeper of secrets for legislators of both parties that history has some holes in it but its generally true and the democrats are worried rister wont be a neutral player craddick and dewhurst have apparently agreed on the pick but the legislators on tlc  appointed by those two  still have to vote on a director theyre scheduled to meet february 1 the traditional bit with judges running for election is that they run as candidates of political parties and they dont take positions on issues that might someday come before them they do accept money from lawyers and parties who might have business before them but they dont discuss those issues in public and in some places theyve been barred from taking part in partisan or seemingly partisan activities the ban on talking about issues slipped a few years ago when the us supreme court said it violated free speech most judicial candidates are reserved about politicking but theyre free now to talk issues to debate political positions and by inference to bang on their opponents like everyone else in politics now some federal courts are knocking down restrictions on politicking the supremes declined to hear a case out of minnesota where lower federal courts struck down state laws that barred direct contributions and partisan politicking in judicial races minnesota was one of 29 or 30 states  weve seen different counts from people who are supposed to know what theyre doing  that was trying to prevent judges from directly soliciting campaign contributions thatll apparently become legal again at least in the federal appellate district that includes minnesota federal courts here and elsewhere are free to follow or to ignore the precedent should lawsuits be filed texans will be happy to note that the postgame editorials used the lone star state as one of the examples of judicial races run amok minnesotas law prevented judges from raising money for themselves from identifying themselves as members of political parties and from attending partisan events among other things the states republican party and a candidate there sued a federal appeals court said the restrictions violated free speech protections in the first amendment a texas judge can call anyone and ask for a political contribution as it stands in minnesota and elsewhere in the 8th us circuit judges can be barred from oneonone or small group solicitations but they can solicit money by letter and in front of large groups in an earlier related case that did get to the us supreme court the justices ruled 54 that candidates cant be barred from stating their views on legal questions and the issues raised in the minnesota case could come up again if someone sues and it winds its way up through the courts its a little thing but the two top photos in the campaign photos section on ben bentzins website have changed the republican house candidate who faded in the closing days and almost lost the special election to succeed todd baxter has edited governor rick perry off of his website perry made an election eve appearance on bentzins behalf and political rivals made hay of it noting the juxtaposition of perrys appearance and bentzins dive at the end of the campaign a 4640 advantage in early voting turned to a 5534 deficit in election day voting with those results combined for a total democrat donna howard missed an outright victory by just 73 votes the bentzin folks poohpoohed talk of a perry effect after the election ended blaming the turn on negative mailers from the local wing of the democratic party but perrys face is gone from wwwbenbentzincom a spokesman says the website is being revamped and that perry quotes and such will be included in the revisions we got several reports of perry emails sent on bentzins behalf that got stalled somewhere on the internet before they finally landed in voters inboxes the vote reminders sent around lunchtime on election day landed on sunday five days after it was over and they included the now unfortunate tagline i look forward to celebrating a tremendous victory when the polls close tonight  theyve got a digital rick perry signature and included a return address at the guvs internet domain the runoff election between howard and bentzin is set for valentines day election officials held a drawing and howards name will appear first on the ballot somebody over at zogby international  a polling company  is playing the political equivalent of fantasy football their work for the wall street journal includes a headtohead race between us senator kay bailey hutchison and former dallas mayor ron kirk who ran two years ago against john cornyn but hasnt publicly expressed any interest in well a couple of years theyve got her winning that one 564 to 332 in a january 19 survey with a  3 percentage point margin of error that was well after candidate filing deadlines and they tried hutchison against the leading democratic opponent houston lawyer barbara ann radnofsky hutchison had a 569318 advantage in that one they included four candidates in their gubernatorial survey and came up with rick perry at 383 percent carole keeton strayhorn and chris bell tied at 179 percent and kinky friedman at 144 percent they didnt include bob gammage wholl face bell in the democratic primary another special election is getting underway as we noted last week new since then is the date voters in grand prairie will replace representative ray allen a republican on feb 28 candidates have until the end of business on monday 130 to sign up so far three have done so republican kirk england libertarian gene freeman and democrat katy hubener those three are also

endorsed two candidates including a challenger to a house committee chairman theyll support anette carlisle an amarillo republican running against representative david swinford rdumas the chairman of the house state affairs committee and theyll back representative delwin jones rlubbock who is being challenged by a couple of his fellow republicans that group is backing both democrats and republicans but is generally situated on the opposite side of house leadership on public education  marta mattox bride of former congressman and texas attorney general jim mattox has gone into the

causes strayhorn said the audit will focus on the 330000 deal between the firm and the states office of statefederal relations governor rick perrys office has defended the contract and another like it

opponents off the ballot including the incumbent because of errors in their campaign filings judges have to include petitions with signatures of people from each of the states judicial regions judge charles holcomb filed the petitions but keel found that some of the signatures were invalid and there were apparently enough clinkers to spoil the filing the texas gop ruled that holcomb is ineligible to run then keel sued to knock robert francis out of the race his infraction was that he didnt write the seat he was seeking in every spot where he should have though place 8 was included in some spots it wasnt in all of them the state party wouldnt disqualify but a state district judge crossed him off the ballot when keel sued  thats a dramatic version of an election year ritual that is also affecting other races in hd87 republican anette carlisle was initially pushed off the ballot by the state gop for belonging to a school board that reimburses candidates for expenses they say thats what the law calls a lucrative position and took her off the ballot the legal provision keeps paid local officeholders from running against state officeholders  a provision that protects state legislators by reducing competition for legislative seats it generally applies to salaries and wages and contract work the state gop says in this case that it also applies when an unpaid officeholder is reimbursed for expenses the texas supreme court overruled that and told the gop to put her back on the ballot they also indicated a written decision will follow possibly explaining this for future cases carlisle is running against david swinford rdumas who knocked an opponent off the ballot with the same law more than a decade ago she quickly got lawyered up and she held an amarillo press conference to blame the whole flap on the incumbent now it could be an issue in their race  does serving on a local groundwater district prohibit you from running for the statehouse depends on who you ask brandon creighton running for the house seat now held by representative ruben hope jr rconroe serves on the lone star groundwater conservation district his county gop says hes eligible to run for the house and that thats not a lucrative office that would keep him off the state ballot hell be on the march ballot against two other republicans who want to replace hope whos running for a district judgeship this year but a fellow board member david kleimann had to go to court to fight the republican party of texas which said hes ineligible for state office for serving on that same board kleimann is in a fourway contest for the gop nomination to succeed senator todd staples rpalestine staples is running for state agriculture commissioner  lest you think this only happens to republicans we direct your attention to south texas where jessica reyesmartinez   the wife of representative armando mando martinez dweslaco  was disqualified for not listing her home address in the right place on her application she wont face her estranged husband in the primary after all  that might have snagged representative ismael kino flores dpalmview he apparently filled out his application the same way reyesmartinez did he would otherwise be unopposed in the primary so the party would have to replace him on the ballot if hes kicked off he could be the replacement or someone else could be  lauro bustamante hoping for a spot on the san antoniobased 4th court of appeals didnt get the right notarization on his petitions for that seat hes out and so is jim sharp who didnt get his application properly notarized in his quest for a place on houstons 1st court of appeals  and former webb county judge mercurio martinez jr is seeing his eligibility challenged for not including the district number in his hd42 race on every page of his application that challenge was leveled by representative richard raymond dlaredo who gave up his run for congress in december and decided to seek reelection martinez who got in the race to replace raymond remained in it to challenge him the texas state teachers association is breaking with tradition to endorse carole keeton strayhorn in the governors race that group which generally supports democrats chose strayhorn an estranged republican running as an independent from a field that includes a republican an independent and two democrats in addition to the state comptroller the endorsement illustrates a trend thats vexing texas democrats and to a lesser extent texas republicans strayhorn is getting financial support for instance from several trial lawyers and other financiers who typically back only democrats tsta has been a regular supporter of democrats that leaves candidates in that party  at least in this race  looking for support from a smaller pool of sympathizers republicans loyal to governor rick perry would prefer that strayhorn have no money or support at all but they hope to make an issue of her appeal to democrats among regular republicans discouraging them from supporting an independent candidate who is allied with their enemies officials with the teacher group say they invited all of the candidates for interviews but that kinky friedman and rick perry didnt chase their political action committees endorsement and though they didnt have anything bad to say about democrats chris bell and bob gammage theyre going with strayhorn strayhorn started her career as a teacher and her political career as a school board member but as a republican she has embraced two ideas abhorred by teacher groups publicly funded vouchers for private schools and merit pay for teachers that would recognize and reward educators who do better work or are in higher demand the candidate says she was for vouchers before the schools were in the shape theyre in but for now says vouchers are off the table  weve got to fix public education  reminded of her previous support strayhorn left the door to that issue ajar that was five years ago and when i talked about vouchers i said you know philosophically i wouldnt have a problem with that for disadvantaged kids but let me tell you what thats before we had five years of this administration that is absolutely totally dismantling our public school system day by day weve got to educate all of our kids and keep them healthy this state is abdicating its responsibilities in education welfare wheres a kid in east texas or west texas gonna take a voucher we have got to fix our public school system and weve got to do it now  she deflected a question about merit pay by saying she has always wanted an acrosstheboard pay raise for all teachers and that low pay is causing high turnover and contributing to high dropout rates in public schools donna new haschke tstas president says her group wont be involved in strayhorns attempt to get 45000 signatures on petitions to put her on the ballot tsta is pushing its 65000 members to vote in the primaries she says and her group will be supporting a list of candidates thatll be revealed in a week or so when the parties have finalized their ballots anyone who votes in a primary for either party will be ineligible to sign petitions for strayhorn or friedman this spring new haschke says the pac abandoned democrats for strayhorn because they think shes got a better chance of beating perry she is right on our issues on every single one of them we couldnt find a stronger advocate  a group of wellknown democratic women endorsed gubernatorial candidate chris bell saying in a letter that both of the top democrats running for governor say theyre prochoice but only one of them has faithfully stood by us in our political fights  thats a shot at bob gammage a former legislator and judge whos running against bell in march along with felix alvarado and rashad jafer bell and gammage have held elective office the other two havent in a letter being sent by the bell campaign to democrats all over the state the 12 women said that when gammage was in congress he was on the antichoice side of just about every vote on reproductive rights  they list a dozen votes they characterize as antichoice including a vote for the socalled hyde amendment that banned medicaid funding for abortions except when the life of the mother was in peril the other votes on their list revolve around that funding ban a spokesman for gammage said the former congressman when in the texas legislature sponsored prochoice legislation before the roe vs wade decision legalized that practice and said the vote on the hyde amendment put gammage in league with dick gephardt and al gore both of whom kept the support of womens groups in spite of that position bob gammage was prochoice before there was a choice said jeremy warren this was not a vote on a womans right to choose but on whether taxpayers should pay for it  the list includes people well known in texas democratic and abortion rights circles liz carpenter heather paffe peggy romberg and sarah weddington of austin karen ostrum george sissy farenthold rita lucido and ginni mithoff of houston molly beth malcolm of texarkana susan hays of dallas beth shapiro of lubbock and claudia stravato of amarillo in their letter a copy of which along with citations of the gammage votes they didnt like is on bells website at wwwchrisbellcom they acknowledge that gammages votes were taken a long time ago the votes theyre decrying were taken in 1977 and 1978 but they say those are the most recent votes available and say bell in contrast got perfect ratings from planned parenthood and naral when he was in congress in 2003 and 2004 the texas court of criminal appeals asked to toss the case against us representative tom delay rsugar land left it intact without comment that sends the matter back to judge pat priest who put the whole matter on hold while it was being considered by the states top criminal court delay had asked the court of criminal appeals to either dismiss the moneylaundering charges against him or to order a speedy trial the idea was to get the whole business finished before congress votes on leadership at the end of the month but his weekend announcement that he was giving up his bid to stay in leadership took the wind out of the thing the court wont speed things up but hes no longer in the hurry he was in before the date that looms now is march 7  the date of the gop primary in which delay faces three republican challengers still pending  at the austinbased 3rd court of appeals  is a lower courts decision to drop conspiracy charges against delay travis county prosecutors appealed that decision texas senators almost never endorse opponents of other texas senators especially when the challengers and the incumbents and the endorsers are from the same political party but eliot shapleigh del paso endorsed carlos uresti in the democratic primary against senator frank madla dsan antonio madlas district stretches well over 500 miles to el paso county the two have tussled over water and other issues there shapleigh called madla a rubber stamp for the failed leadership in austin and said hes too close to the republicans who are in power  some of the states top lobbyists and public affairs types have agreed to work together  sometimes  and to pitch some business together the texas capitol group would be better characterized as a friendly conspiracy than a company since everybody in the mix will keep their own business and clients alongside the new deal the players include lobbyists mike toomey bill messer walter fisher lara keel and billy phenix and public affairs consultants rossanna salazar ray sullivan wayne fleenor jennifer harris and mona taylor theyve got a website up and

Switch Now, Fight Later	2006-01-09	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2006/01/09/switch-now-fight-later/	en	hardly anyone whos not employed by carole keeton strayhorn thinks she would win a republican primary in nine weeks against governor rick perry its more his audience than hers he can match her dollar for dollar and then some and shes based her campaign all along on the idea that she needs swing voters in addition to moderate republicans to wrest the mansion away from the current occupant she contends shed have won a primary albeit a bloody one but the truth is that strayhorn has a better chance running as an independent in november with a broad array of texas voters than as a republican fighting perry in march for the support of the undiluted conservatives who dominate the gop primary still some folks were quietly surprised that she would actually pull the trigger running as an independent instead of seeking the gop nomination for the states top elective office another surprise that shouldnt be surprising most of her supporters are sticking with her theyd already stated their opposition to perry with strayhorns jump the race for governor includes a republican who used to be a democratic legislator but switched parties to seek statewide office perry an independent who ran as a republican candidate for county office several years ago friedman an independent who switched from the democratic party to the republican party and then decided to skip the gop primary on the way to the general election and four democrats strayhorn never ran for office as a democrat though she was identified that way for years helping walter mondales presidential campaign and accepting an appointment to the old state insurance board from thengovernor mark white a democrat she declared herself a republican in the mid1980s to run against popular us representative jj jake pickle daustin she lost but later won a spot on the texas railroad commission and then the comptroller job strayhorn has never been on the ballot using the name strayhorn she was elected to the austin school board and as mayor of austin and to the texas railroad commission she lost a congressional race and to the comptrollers office under the names mcclellan and rylander her maiden name keeton is locally famous her dad was dean of the ut law school and her one tough grandma tagline is well known to voters but she still has to build name id with voters as strayhorn thats one justification for the early television campaign thats now underway to tie all of those things together and to tell voters shes running as an independent loose end 1 if she gets on the ballot shell be the only woman among as many as five candidates when you go to the polls in november loose end 2 the legislature will probably be in session this spring  after the democratic and republican primaries and runoffs  working on school finance at the same time carole keeton strayhorn and kinky friedman will be gathering signatures to get on the ballot that means strayhorn as state comptroller will be issuing financial estimates and pronouncements at the same time that strayhorn as a candidate is politicking for support call some pollsters and theyll talk to you about the votes due to a candidate just for the party label attached to that candidates name you can argue about the numbers so well just be arbitrary about it in the 2002 elections david dewhurst won with the smallest share of votes collected by any statewide republican in a race with a democrat 52 percent marty akins was on the democratic end of that scale getting the smallest share of the vote for a democrat running against a republican in a statewide race 33 percent some pollsters  reputable people from good families even  will tell you that kinky friedman and carole keeton strayhorn will be fighting over whats left plus whatever they can whittle away from those two party base votes the conventional wisdom is that a fiveway race with a republican a democrat a libertarian and two independents would produce a republican governor who gets into office with less than 50 percent of the vote rick perrys camp subscribes to that idea and so do many consultants weve jabbered with who arent directly involved in anyones campaign for governor but there are some interesting possibilities out there that friedman and strayhorn hope to see to fruition perry could stumble or oversee a fumble by the legislature or a natural disaster or whatever that would make anyone whos not him more attractive caroles money  substantial for a candidate whether independent or not  or kinkys celebrity could change the dynamics of the race dissatisfaction with perry in particular or republicans in general could lower his vote giving them an opportunity to win some votes democratic consultants of the optimistic breed see another scenario where the two independents and the libertarian usually good for two or three percentage points that would otherwise land in the gop column split swing voters and leech votes away from perry like the independents theyre depending on his unpopularity rising by election day a democrat who can hold onto his own base vote could win residency in the governors mansion with well under 50 percent support if the four other candidates split the rest of the vote into small enough pieces the two bestfunded gubernatorial candidates started the year with their first run of television commercials and both aim to introduce themselves to voters without too much bickering perry was up first starting during bowl games with a proud of texas campaign in which he touts the states economic development education and lawsuit reform efforts its reminiscent of the morning in america campaign that marked ronald reagans reelection effort in 1984 perrys spot ends with him saying our people are compassionate our visions bold our values strong the best is yet to come im proud of texas how bout you  its also a contrast with strayhorns line which aims at people who want a change like perry shes on camera in her spot doing all the talking she says things are messed up citing partisanship nine legislative sessions full of namecalling a crisis in school funding high property taxes and judges are having to do our governors job  her tag im a republican but ive decided to put partisan politics aside to run for governor as an independent one tough time might need one tough grandma to shake austin up  neither campaign would detail its advertising schedules or spending but both say their ads are running statewide and that the buys are serious this is unofficial since some candidates file locally and some with the state the official versions havent been assembled by the state parties with that caveat heres a first look at what voters will see in the first round of the 2006 elections this list includes candidates for statewide offices congress and the texas legislature as they say on tv check local listings and if we missed something in the mix of local and state filings let us know and well patch it immediately get our list at wwwtexasweeklycomdocuments2006candidatespdf heres the short form in three sections not one member of the texas delegation to congress will leave office voluntarily after this term but only two  republican michael conaway of midland and democrat al green of houston  will get through the year without an opponent everybody else in that 32member political class will face major or minor party

Will She or Won't She?	2005-12-19	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2005/12/19/will-she-or-wont-she/	en	saying that youre a republican and that youre a candidate for governor or even that youre a republican candidate for governor is not the same as saying youll seek the gops nomination for that office in 2006 and thats why the states scribbling scrum of political reporters wont close the door on speculation that carole keeton strayhorn will run as an independent next year strayhorn the states comptroller has been a leading republican vote getter in past general elections but her results in contested statewide primaries are mixed and facing incumbent governor rick perry in a gop primary dominated by the social conservatives who put him in office is daunting things change rapidly in politics but every poll weve seen shows perry smothering the comptroller if the primary were held now even if she hasnt raised a dime in the current sixmonth period  an unlikely prospect  strayhorn will enter 2006 with at least 5 million in her campaign chest the primary elections are on march 7 or nine weeks after the first of the year anyone who can spend at the rate of roughly 500000 per week has to be considered a threat no matter what the polls say now even if thats all the money shes got  an unlikely prospect  shell be a heckuva pest next year in either a gop primary or as an independent candidate strayhorns political strength has always been in the general election where swing voters and crossover democrats dilute the hardcore republican voters who control the outcomes in gop primaries in march running as an independent has risks  its hard to get on the ballot and theres not a party organization in place to provide volunteer and grassroots support but if she thinks the march primary is perrys to win an independent run keeps her in the game until at least the midmay deadline for the petitions needed to put her on the ballot strayhorn has until january 2 to make her intentions known thats the deadline for filing either as a republican a democrat or an independent what would it mean if she ducks the primaries  shed have to put a petitionsigning network together the whole reason for political parties is to maintain such networks but independents like kinky friedman have to build their own organizations friedmans campaign is deeply into that process and has organized 50 or 60 of the larger counties in texas the one tough grandma party would have to start from scratch relying in part on disenchanted republicans who might form the nucleus of a statewide organization for her independent candidacy if that is such republicans exist one hurdle is friedman who has already been harvesting antiperry and antiparty voters hes the bigger celebrity is more organized at this point and is in a position to tag her as a me too independent  the legislature is coming back in april or may to try to hammer the states school finance system into constitutional form strayhorn as comptroller will deliver the official numbers on their tax and revenue proposals that provides her an opportunity for political mischief and how its received will depend on whether shes politically dead or alive if by spring shes a gop primary loser and a former candidate for governor shell be easier to ignore if on the other hand shes a gubernatorial candidate in the middle of a petition drive to get on the ballot in november shell get more attention  never discount the power of a mistake or a failure perry with an assist from the courts and another from his tax commission pushed the special session on school finance to the other side of the primary elections he and the legislature didnt look so hot when the special sessions ended in failure last summer and an unpopular result this spring could put him and others in bad light with voters anybody whos out of the picture after march can only watch and think of what might have been but strayhorn friedman and whatever democrat survives that primary could all be the beneficiaries of another failure   if there is one  on school finance  low talk among some austin republicans over the last several months has focused on whether strayhorn would switch parties and run as a democrat she was a democrat in the first place but jumped to the gop in the 1980s to mount an illfated challenge to thenus representative jj jake pickle daustin you can still find democrats in central texas who are still angry about that one of her sons  scott mcclellan  is the spokesman for the nations top republican george w bush and shes not prochoice like most democrats are a switch from the elephants to donkeys would be a tough row to hoe besides shes consistently said shes a republican and intends to remain one isnt it possible that shes telling the truth  an independent strayhorn could be really bad news for democrats like felix alvarado chris bell and bob gammage some of the financiers who are typically with democrats are with strayhorn this time if shes out of the race in march some of those contributors might be interested in the democratic nominee if shes still in the race theyll still be with her and the democrats will still be looking for funding from a shrunken donor base  perry is acting like he thinks hell see strayhorn in the march primary hes got an internetonly ad that ties her to former lieutenant governor ben barnes now a lobbyist and youll remember a central figure in the 60 minutes story on george w bushs time in the air national guard barnes hosted a strayhorn fundraiser and perry is promising to remind people of the link you can watch his ad at this address wwwrickperryorgmultimediafilesstaytunedmov  file this one under loose ends texans who decide to sign an independent candidates petition to get on the ballot cant sign the petition of another candidate seeking the same office at the same time for instance if strayhorn skips the primary she and friedman wont be allowed to share any renegade voters texans who appear on both lists will be struck from both lists theres a reminder at the top of each petition form warning the signers theyre only allowed one signature per contest the united states supreme court will hear an appeal of the texas congressional redistricting case in early march raising at least the possibility that congressional primaries held that same month would have to be repeated later in the year the current maps were redrawn in middecade after republicans took control of the state legislature after approval from the bush administration and by a threejudge federal panel they were used to elect a congressional delegation that for the first time in modern history features a republican majority congressional redistricting has provided texas politics with a steady diet of drama for most of the current decade the legislature couldnt agree on congressional maps in 2001 and so a panel of federal judges drew one based in large measure on a democratdrawn map put in place during the 1990s it gave republicans only 15 of the 32 seats in the delegation in 2002 republicans took over a majority of seats in the texas house and used that new advantage to elect speaker tom craddick rmidland and then to draw new congressional maps that when finally in place put republicans in 21 of the 32 texas seats during the fight over maps the legislature was blocked once when most house democrats left the state for ardmore oklahoma to deny the house a quorum and blocked again when 11 senate democrats spent a month in albuquerque new mexico to halt consideration in the upper chamber neither holdout affected the final result republican legislators got a late and critical assist from us representative tom delay of sugar land and drew the map thats now in place staff lawyers for the us department of justice unanimously rejected this version but were overruled by their bosses a threejudge federal panel ratified that decision and the 2004 elections gave the republicans six more seats in the texas delegation one democrat  ralph hall of rockwall  switched parties another  jim turner of crockett  didnt seek reelection and was replaced by a republican four democrats martin frost of dallas nick lampson of beaumont max sandlin of marshall and charlie stenholm of abilene  lost reelection bids to republicans those seats were the only net gains in the entire us house that year the groups that sued to overturn the case all of the cases have been rolled into one argue variously that the new plan illegal dilutes the voting power of minorities that the new maps were drawn for no reason other than partisan gerrymandering and that the designers of new maps should have been forced to use new census data to account for growth in the state since the 2000 census was completed the argument was that the growth was disproportionately in minority populations who because they werent recounted in a new census were cheated of their electoral clout they simply arent accounted for in the maps adopted by the legislature the supremes will hear arguments on march 1 of next year  about a week before the democratic and republican primaries and theyll probably rule  if the proceedings follow their normal course  before the july 4 break should they rule the maps illegal as the court did in a 1996 redistricting case from texas they could toss out the results of the primaries and order new congressional elections state representative richard raymond dlaredo is giving up his bid for congress and has filed with the webb county elections office to run for reelection to the texas house hes been working on a challenge to us representative henry cuellar dlaredo former us representative ciro rodriguez dsan antonio was knocked off by cuellar last year in a very tight race that changed outcomes several times before the courts ended recount fights in cuellars failure rodriguez is also challenging cuellar this year and hoped to benefit from a laredo vote split by cuellar and raymond the district stretches from zapata county on the south to hays county on the north or from the states border with mexico almost to the texas capital raymond held a financial lead over the other two democrats in that race at the end of september but it was largely due to 300000 in loans guaranteed by raymond himself he collected 199225 from individuals during the first nine months of the year according to fec data compiled by political moneyline wwwfecinfocom and he spent 76996 during that same period as of september 30 he had 430397 in the campaign till cuellar raised more 486491 spent more 193604 borrowed none and had less on hand when the period ended 279645 rodriguez raised 104251 spent 44777 didnt borrow anything and ended up with 70596 in a written statement raymond referred to the us supreme courts decision to hear the texas redistricting case and the possibility that the court will change the lines in texas as a result he didnt say this redrawing if it happens could knock some candidates out of their chance to win a spot in congress by forcing new elections under a new map since the court isnt hearing that case until march raymond and others in similar situations have to decide whether to risk running for election in a district that might not exist in eight months or to stay put and run for offices they know wont change during the 2006 elections raymonds move from one race to the other and then back  while it looks like the safer move  could easily backfire while he was out of the race for reelection in hd42 former webb county judge mercurio martinez also a democrat got in now that raymonds back martinez called him a friend but said hell stay in the race he said he hopes raymond will now support the congressional candidate who will make sure our community continues to have a voice in washington  thatd be a plug for cuellar and while he didnt say anything negative about the incumbent he said this about his own self i am a man of my word my community knows where i stand i do not switch from side to side  only 3512 houstonians turned up for a special election to fill joe morenos shoes in hd143 the winner with 61 percent of the vote was ana hernandez a former aide to moreno who was backed by most of houstons democrats in the state legislature laura salinas got 1365 votes to hernandez 2147  a margin of 782 votes more people  6174  voted in the first round which had six candidates in it hernandez got more raw votes with 2625 but only mustered 425 percent in the november election all four of the losers endorsed salinas to no avail one more thing next years elections mainly the democratic primary will determine who gets a full term starting in january 2007 bob gammage who resigned from the texas supreme court and left state government in the mid1990s will seek the democratic partys nomination for governor he filed his papers with a blast at governor rick perry and little to say to

                          Flaws seen in purge of 'dead' voters         	2012-11-01	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://www.chron.com//elections/article/Flaws-seen-in-purge-of-dead-voters-4002201.php	en	state election officials repeatedly and mistakenly matched active longtime texas voters to deceased strangers across the country  some of whom perished more than a decade ago  in an errorridden effort to purge dead voters just weeks before the presidential election according to a review of records voters in legislative districts across texas with heavy concentrations of hispanics or african americans were more often targeted in that flawed purge effort according to the houston chronicles analysis of more than 68000 voters identified as possibly dead its unclear why so many more matches were generated in some minority legislative districts one factor may be the popularity of certain surnames in hispanic and historically black neighborhoods one mismatch threatened the voter registration of james harris jr a us air force veteran who has voted in every presidential election since the richard nixon era harris who is african american and shares a name with a dead arkansas man last voted in harris county in july yet inexplicably weeks later he received a letter asking if hed died  apparently because of the 1996 death of another james harris according to the chronicle review harris told the chronicle he hasnt been able to shake the feeling that someone has gone to a concerted effort and gone to a lot of time and research coming up with this matrix in a way of being able to knock people off of the voting rolls  his daughter got a dead voter letter too she shares her name and birthday with a louisiana woman who died in 2010 unlike harris and dallas counties which saw a large number of mistaken dead voter notices bexar county encountered few problems thats because the states list of potentially dead voters is routinely culled before the letters are issued drastically reducing the number of mistaken notices bexar county elections administrator jacque callanen told the expressnews the county uses several techniques to verify whether someone on the states list is alive including a check on whether they voted in recent elections she said rich parsons a spokesman for the texas secretary of states office confirmed that officials compared information about all texas voters  including many whod voted since 2010  to longdead people in the social security administrations death database which dates to 1973 so far only 6491 voters identified have been purged he said state officials did not use addresses middle names or voting history to weed out false matches nor was race or ethnicity a factor he said neither the official list of registered voters nor the social security death master file contain any racial or ethnic data making it impossible for race or ethnicity to play any role or impact in this process he said voters of all races received letters including republican state representative wayne smith of baytown who is anglo he apparently was matched with another smith who died 1500 miles away in pennsylvania last year he was one of more than 4000 smiths who made the state list parsons noted that no geographical information or addresses were used in the dead voter matchups i would also remind you the social security administration does not guarantee the accuracy of its own list he said an austin lawyer  who successfully sued to slow the flawed purge process  was apparently mixed up with a wisconsin resident deceased since 2003 according to the chronicle review of social security administration death data in an agreement reached in response to the travis county lawsuit targeted voters were told they will not be purged unless their deaths are confirmed but so far state officials have made no promises to improve the matching process the settlement did not change or impact the process in any way parsons said texas legislators passed a law in 2011 requiring election officials to use social security administration death data to clean voter rolls last summer election officials prepared two lists one contained 8238 socalled strong matches  where voters names social security numbers and dates of birth matched the dead it generated little controversy a much larger list with more that 68000 weak matches  many determined based on names and birth dates alone  wrought complaints protests from dallas and harris county registrars and the civil suit in travis county the matching effort was overseen by state director of

for governor rick perry texas voter data includes no ethnicity information however the chronicle found voters living in legislative districts with high percentages of hispanics or african americans were more likely to be listed as dead than others statewide in fact voters in eight heavily minority districts in dallas houston el paso and brownsville were twice as likely to be targeted as voters statewide within dallas houston austin and san antonio voters living in african american or hispanic legislative districts created to improve minority representation also were generally more likely to be listed than those in surrounding counties the newspapers analysis found state lawmakers including house elections committee vice chair ana hernandez luna a houston democrat already have pledged to review the process to determine why so many voters were wrongly targeted her own district which is heavily hispanic had a high match rate state representative barbara mallory caraway a dallas democrat says she too wants to know why the analysis appeared to have a disproportionate impact on districts like hers which has a high concentration of african american voters im obviously very alarmed and

                          How liberal or conservative is your state rep?         	2011-07-12	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://blog.chron.com/bakerblog/2011/07/how-liberal-or-conservative-is-your-state-rep/	en	 some rights reserved by frank jaquier ccbysa political scientists have long used roll call votes cast by members of the us congress to plot the legislators on the liberalconservative dimension along which most legislative politics in our nations capitol as well as in austin now takes place here drawing on all 999 nonlopsided roll call votes held during the combined 2011 regular and first special legislative sessions i provide similar information for the members of the texas house of representatives with particular focus on the 37 representatives from the 10county houston metropolitan region details on the methodology employed for the analysis and coding are provided here this analysis allows us to rank in order all of the members of the texas house of representatives from most liberal 1 to most conservative 149 based on their roll call vote behavior as well as to compare members of the each party with each other ie democrats to other democrats and republicans to other republicans in the latter case we can assess the extent to which specific democrats are more or less liberal than their colleagues and the degree to which specific republicans are more or less conservative than the other members of the republican delegation in all cases it is important to keep in mind that this methodology is based entirely on the representatives observed roll call vote behavior and does not take into account the myriad of other activities which are much more difficult if not impossible in many cases to reliably observe legislators engage in every texas house democrat is significantly more liberal than every texas house republican during 2011 compared to the whole texas house democratic party delegation the 14strong houstonarea democratic party delegation is noticeably liberal in its voting behavior with nine houston democrats among the partys more liberal members but only two among its more conservative members the complete data and rankings for all 149 texas house members can be found here the most liberal representative in the houston area delegation is jessica farrar followed immediately by armando walle farrars voting record on the house floor in 2011 locates her as the fourth most liberal member of the texas house and significantly more liberal than 29 of her 48 democratic colleagues not to mention all 100 republicans speaker joe straus does not normally cast roll call votes walle was the fifth most liberal representative in the 2011 texas house and noticeably more liberal than 25 of his fellow democrats another group seven total ranging from ana hernandez luna as the eighth most liberal to boris miles as the 21st most liberal occupies the remaining portion of the liberal side of the democratic partys liberalconservative spectrum within the party local legislators senfronia thompson ranked 26th hubert vo 28th and alma allen 29th find themselves in the center in the more conservative wing of the party are only two area democrats scott hochberg in the 31st position and craig eiland eiland is the legislatures third most conservative democrat 46th and possesses a voting record that places him as significantly more conservative than all but seven of his 48 democratic copartisans the 23member houstonarea republican delegation roughly reflects the statewide delegation in terms of its ideological diversity at the conservative end of the spectrum ranked 141st randy weber is the ninth most conservative member of the texas house and the most conservative houstonarea representative with a voting record that is significantly more conservative than that of 73 of his fellow 99 republican house members following weber among the most conservative republicans are brandon creighton 139th james white 135th ken legler 133rd dennis bonnen 129th allen fletcher 123rd and william callegari 120th a large contingent of houstonarea republicans is located within the ideological center of the republican party note this does not signify that these representatives are necessarily ideologically moderate rather only that they are in the middle of the ideological road among texas house republicans in 2011 this ninemember group ranges from debbie riddle 113th to larry taylor 86th the final group of area republicans has voting records that make them more moderate than between onethird and a little more than twothirds of their fellow house republicans it is crucial to recall that the broader interparty data indicate that not a single texas republican house member is a liberal  in fact the least conservative texas house republican aaron pea of edinburg is substantially more conservative than the most conservative house democrat tracy king of batesville the chasm that divides the two parties in the texas house can be graphically seen in this figure however these data do indicate that the members of this final group especially those in the second subgroup are significantly more moderate in terms of their ideological roll call voting record than a noteworthy share of their fellow house republicans the first subgroup consists of a set of legislators including john otto 77th sarah davis 75th beverly woolley 70th wayne smith 69th and john otto 68th who are more moderate than at least onethird but less than onehalf of their republican colleagues the two most moderate republicans in the houston area are rob eissler 54th and john davis 53rd only recent partyswitchers aaron pea 2010 allan ritter of nederland 2010 and charles chuck hopson of jacksonville 2009 have less conservative voting records than davis and eissler within the republican caucus davis voting record is significantly less conservative than 81 of his fellow republicans while eisslers is significantly less conservative than 79 overall a wide range of ideological perspectives are represented by the houstonarea texas house delegation with the very liberal jessica farrar balanced by the very conservative randy weber at opposing ends of the liberalconservative dimension this variation is also present at the intraparty level especially within the republican party where coexisting within the regions republican delegation were representatives who are among the state partys most conservative eg randy weber and brandon creighton and least conservative john davis rob eissler members analysis of the data focusing on the entire state can be found in this texas tribune article mark p jones is the james a baker iii institute for public policys fellow in political science as well as the joseph d jamail chair in latin american studies and chair of the department of political science at rice university
                          Lawmaker sees issue through undocumented past         	2011-06-02	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://www.chron.com//sacultura/conexion/article/Lawmaker-sees-issue-through-undocumented-past-1404827.php	en	state representative ana hernandez luna stood before the house on the afternoon of may 9 hours after lawmakers passed the controversial sanctuary city bill and started reading from a prepared statement her eyes downcast immigration and all that it encompasses is very personal for me because i was an undocumented immigrant hernandez luna 32 said in a halting and teary speech you may prefer to use the word illegal alien but im not an alien i am not a problem that must be handled im a human  a person standing before you now as a representative for the texas house  with her roughly fiveminute speech she did what some would consider crazy in the current political climate she tried to put a human face  her own  on the illegal immigration issue i believe they have a perception of what an undocumented immigrant should be and i dont fit in that she said in a recent interview some of her colleagues across the aisle were unmoved  at least from a policy perspective they have a firm hold on the house and had overwhelmingly passed hb 12 the bill which ultimately failed to make it through the senate would have kept local governments from prohibiting their police from enforcing federal immigration laws i admire the difficulties that she has overcome said state representative debbie riddle rtomball but i still stand strong that we have got to protect our borders we need to enforce our laws  hernandez luna said her parents packed up a single suitcase and brought her to houston from reynosa mexico as an infant along with her 4yearold sister they overstayed their visitors visas and lived undocumented for eight years her parents paid taxes she said and bought a house in houston within about five years she remembers fearing as a little girl that her mother would be picked up by immigration agents staking out the local fiesta grocery store or that her father would not come home after one of his overnight warehouse shifts celia fleischman principal at gardens elementary school in pasadena said she remembered hernandez luna struggling with her english but quickly catching on her mother worked in the school cafeteria and hernandez luna would come in early and sleep in the corner waiting for school to start she always had her nose in a book and was ready to speak up for others fleischman said she was very smart and opinionated even as a little girl i know why now fleischman said with a laugh but hernadez luna was shy when it came to where her family was from she remembers her parents relief when congress under president reagan passed the 1986 amnesty that granted legal status to an estimated 3 million illegal immigrants as her family sank deeper roots opening their own restaurant at a flea market hernandez luna graduated from high school at 16 gained citizenship at 18 attended the university of houston and interned at the state capitol out of college she spent two years working at the capitol before enrolling in the university of texas school of law not long after starting her first job as a lawyer one of the legislators she had worked for representative joe moreno died in a car accident his staffers and supporters asked her to run in a special election for his seat she said and she took an eightmonth unpaid leave of absence to campaign she handily beat her opponent and at age 27 she started representing district 143 a solidly workingclass predominantly hispanic neighborhood that sprawls alongside the houston ship channel east of downtown her immigration history didnt come up during the 2005 campaign she said ive never hidden the fact that i was born in mexico its on my bio born in reynosa she said at the time i ran in 2005 we really didnt have that antiimmigrant sentiment  for now her attention is largely focused on breadandbutter issues immigration enforcement is a federal issue not one for state legislatures she said she remembers bristling the first time she shared her immigration story with fellow lawmakers at a latenight committee meeting in 2007 when riddle the tomball republican said something to the effect of youve been given a gift from god  my response to her was i havent been given anything my parents and i have worked very hard for everything i have been able to achieve and accomplish riddle remembers it slightly differently i told her she had been blessed yes indeed riddle said when somebody says that theyre blessed that doesnt mean that theyre laying under a shade tree sipping on lemonade and the blessings just fall on top of them  on one point the two lawmakers agree the issue comes down to opportunity but they remain worlds apart on who is entitled to it im grateful for the opportunity that ive been given and i think it is incumbent upon me to ensure that others have that opportunity hernandez luna said were not giving anything away were giving you the opportunity

regarding putting a face on issue page b1 monday i read with interest the life story of state representative ana hernandez luna and her family i so enjoyed hearing about the drive and determination of those in this country albeit illegally but nonetheless trying to work and stand on their own rather than just take handouts she has a lot to be proud of but i strongly disagree with her lack of understanding that she and her family were given a gift from god he enabled them to have a place where their hard work would lead to their striving and then allow them to thrive yes i do believe she and her family worked hard but without god giving them a chance in this country their life story would be different  lark billickmanvel  riddle is right state representative ana hernandez luna and her family broke the laws of the state of texas and the united states of america i agree completely with representative debbie riddle we must secure our borders and enforce our immigration laws the death of houston police officer kevin will is the result of our inability to close the border and keep track of who enters texas officer killed in line of duty page a1 monday representative lunas gift from god was not being found out prior to 1986  barbara fenskehouston  a nation of laws i applaud our texas legislature for passing a bill to deal with cities that look the other way with the tide of illegal border jumpers into our state but honestly who could blame otherwise honest hardworking people for leaving the corrupt and ineffective government of mexico to find a better life given the same set of circumstances i too would leave to seek a safe and more prosperous life for my family whats the downside what state representative lunas family did was illegal therefore they were unlawful immigrants and contrary to her statements otherwise they were a problem and should have been prevented from entering her family jumped ahead of others who legally apply and wait years to gain legal status i save my pity for those who work hard through the system the reason so many flee their third world homelands for the us is generations of naturalborn citizens peppered with selected and measured groups of immigrants from around the world built this great nation a nation of laws  the very laws representative luna is tasked to help create she and many others are driven by a misguided sense of sympathy empathy or are on a personal mission to rewrite our laws to suit their feelings her parents rolled the dice and won we never enforced our laws which she still doesnt want enforced im not antiimmigrant xenophobic hater of anyone i do want to preserve our laws border and culture we the people deserve and expect to be protected in our sanctuary called america so that we may pursue our happiness whether by birthright or naturalized legally through our laws  craig hagedornhouston  respect of law the article was a tribute to a young woman who believes that the illegals are entitled to come to this country use our health and school systems to the advantage of those lawbreakers who dare to excel any way possible most telling of all is the statement that she hasnt been given anything and that her parents and she worked very hard for everything that she has been able to achieve and accomplish well the citizens of this country have also worked very very hard with the difference being there is a respect of laws  esther liptaisugar land    holiday respect in order regarding many add bit of fun to somber holiday page b1 tuesday at 92 years and a world war ii veteran i have noticed many memorial day services and this years events brought me to the conclusion that many including politicians do not know the proper way to respect the national anthem andor the passing of the american flag when our anthem is being sung or played all veterans in uniform or not should stand at attention with a hand salute and do so when the flag is passing all nonveterans male or female child or adult should stand at attention with their right hand over their heart they should show respect by not talking sing if they wish but do not applaud until the last note is played if we

on firearms trafficking neglects to mention among other things the active cooperation between members of the firearms industry and law enforcement for example the national shooting sports foundation nssf the trade association for americas firearms industry has partnered with the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives atf for over a decade on a national campaign to make the public aware that it is a serious crime to straw purchase a firearm the industryfunded program called dont lie for the other guy also helps atf educate firearms retailers to better detect and prevent illegal straw purchases  which contrary to freedmans unsubstantiated claim never spiked after 2004 a recent report from the independent research group stratfor determined that less than 12 percent of the guns seized in mexico came from the united states in fact according to atf statistics the average age of recovered firearms in mexico is more than 14 years past the original date of purchase a clear indicator that these firearms were not recently straw purchased in the united states in recent years as many as 150000 mexican soldiers have defected to work for the drug cartels  bringing their americanmade serviceissued firearms with them it has also been welldocumented by the washington post that the drug cartels are illegally smuggling fullyautomatic firearms grenades and other weapons into mexico from south and central america such items are not being purchased at retail firearms stores in the united states we respect and applaud president calderons willingness to take on his

                          Will HISD trustees approve the bond plan? Undecided.         	2012-08-08	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://blog.chron.com/k12zone/2012/08/will-hisd-trustees-approve-the-bond-plan-undecided/	en	houston isd trustees were not unified wednesday night around a proposed 19 billion bond plan they are scheduled to vote on thursday a majority of the trustees have not yet committed publicly to supporting the plan though in interviews they left open the possibility none of the trustees has questioned the need to rebuild and upgrade the districts aging schools but they have expressed questions about the process for selecting campuses and the distribution of the money the plan recommended by hisd superintendent terry grier based on an outside study of the districts facilities would rebuild remodel or renovate nearly all the districts high schools and a handful of elementary and middle schools lastminute talks between trustees and grier and his staff continued wednesday meanwhile other elected officials upped pressure on hisd officials to modify the proposal i dont know whats going to happen hisd board president mike lunceford said about the board vote thursday if the board approves the plan it would go before voters in november grier declined to discuss the boards indecision but repeated his plea that many of the districts schools need serious improvements to give students across the city access to modern buildings its very difficult to keep kids coming to crummy facilities he said the thing about these facilities they get worse every year  hisd trustee paula harris who has indicated her support for the plan expressed optimism wednesday night that the board would rally for a unanimous vote i think there will be nine votes for it she said this board is about children  several elected officials submitted an opinion piece to the houston chronicle expressing concern over the process used to select which schools would be rebuilt and the size of the campuses the letter was sent by us representative gene green state senator mario gallegos state representatives ana hernandez luna and armando walle and former harris county commissioner sylvia garcia it is also worth questioning the districts wisdom of proposing and seeking approval of such a massive bond election in the midst of this recovering but slow economy the letter said in part the bond issue is likely to phase in a 7cent property tax hike costing the owner of a 200000 home an extra 99 a year in 2017 we would be inclined to support a thoughtful resourcemaximizing plan created via a transparent and fair process the letter continued however questions remain unanswered on how decisions were made in creating this bond proposal and they must be answered before we can support this referendum  state representative sylvester turner the loudest critic of hisds 2007 bond issue spoke out last week saying the plan shortchanged booker t washington high griers plan calls for 52 million to build a school for up to 1300 students the districts first africanamerican school enrolled about 825 students last year if youre counting votes heres what the trustees have told me expected yes votes harvin moore said last week he was in favor of the bond larry marshall said monday he was a strong supporter harris agreed uncommitted with some more easily swayed than others rhonda skillernjones said last week she was leaning toward voting yes but said wednesday that shes still not sold lunceford repeated that hes unsure but planned to meet with grier thursday morning manuel rodriguez jr said wednesday that he wants to support the bond and let voters decide but hes worried about the distribution of funds asked for specifics he said its just too much to get into  juliet stipeche has been among the most vocal critics particularly concerned that her alma mater the high school for law enforcement and criminal justice is not included and upset that revisions to griers initial plan downsized some schools in her eastside district greg meyers the lone hisd trustee to vote against the 2007 bond plan expressed concerns last week asking for more detail hes not prone to support a tax increase anna eastman said monday that she falls in the concerned camp the board is scheduled to meet at 5 pm a vote is not expected to take place until a few hours later with members of the public allowed to address the board and trustees likely to have long discussions follow on the blog or on twitter at emellon for live updates
                          Commentary: HISD bond proposal lacking in transparency         	2012-08-09	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://www.chron.com//opinion/outlook/article/Commentary-HISD-bond-proposal-lacking-in-3773609.php	en	today the houston independent school district hisd board of trustees will consider the districts revised proposal for a 19 billion bond referendum to provide much needed rehabilitation renovation expansion and improvement to school facilities board approval will mean hisd voters decide on nov 6 whether to approve this contemplated plan that focuses on the districts high schools as stewards of public funds school districts and their boards have a duty to ensure resources including bond proceeds are maximized so the children they serve have the highest possible opportunity to succeed within a large school district like hisd the needs of children and staff vary widely so the duty of fairness in the process of allocating these resources and in the allocation itself is even more important in voting on the referendum hisd voters will decide if the terms of the bond proposal meet these obligations hisd hired parsons construction to conduct a needs assessment of its school facilities for this bond parsons findings confirm in its reports what many here in the city already knew about their aging schools the original bond proposal recommended by the district to its board would have addressed many of the schools in need of major improvements to their facilities but at the possible expense of other schools including those in highneed highgrowth areas of the district the revised bond proposal being considered today conceived as an improvement from the original hisd proposal has the same issues of shortchanging highneedhighgrowth areas both the original and revised bond proposals to address parsons findings on hisd facilities dont seem to match with the driving considerations of the changing demographics of the city and where future generations will be attending schools in houston in regard to these considerations publications available on the district website allude to  community changes and demographics without explanation of the type of data and how it was actually used to determine projections on enrollment and utilization where hisd has otherwise offered reasonably comprehensive documentation on the condition of facilities this dearth of supporting information on the projections raises issues of transparency and fairness of the process the differences in the various allocations between the original and current proposal raise even more concerns about the process by which these recommendations are made even given the specific enrollment projections determined by an unknown hisd black box formula recommendations for the student capacity of replacement or renovation of certain facilities vary widely between the original and revised proposal as student capacity quickly drives up the price tag of facility improvements it is difficult not to be skeptical and wonder why there were such large changes in capacity between the two proposals between parsons findings and the community input it sought as well as the data that hisd supplied the facts with which hisd made its original recommendations on these numbers did not change in making the revised recommendation additionally from the original to the revised bond proposal money was shifted to some schools but as the bond amount remained the same this shift was at the cost of other schools which presumably had significant needs again better guidance must be offered on why these decisions were made before moving forward in a time when government entities like school districts are surviving on much tighter operating budgets and given prior incidents of ethical lapses associated with the hisd procurement process the district must ensure the bond proceeds are allocated with the needs of the children in mind and not the needs of adults and their associated politics that can skew decisionmaking it is also worth questioning the districts wisdom of proposing and seeking approval of such a massive bond election in the midst of this recovering but slow economy hisd has already acknowledged that final approval of the bond will likely necessitate a corresponding property tax increase indicating that the district already knows that it does not yet have the revenue capacity to support this amount of new debt service in any case fiscal responsibility must be exercised as we consider this proposal which would be one of the largest school bond issues in us history we would be inclined to support a thoughtful resourcemaximizing plan created by a transparent and fair process however questions remain unanswered on how decisions were made in creating this bond proposal and they must be answered before we can support this referendum ultimately hisd voters can hold the bond proposal and the district accountable for how it meets the duties of fairness and giving our children the highest opportunities to succeed this article was

or make women anxious and lead to overtreatment remains to be seen doctors said an  estimated 15562 new cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed this year  in texas women according to the texas department of state health  services more than 2800 texans are expected to die from breast cancer  in 2011 the cases include 1013 new breast cancer diagnoses and 173  deaths estimated for travis hays williamson bastrop and caldwell  counties according to the austin affiliate of susan g komen for the  cure while mammograms remain the gold standard for breast cancer screening they are not perfect jury is still out a woman in dallas who learned she had dense breasts stressed that point prompting the new texas law henda  salmeron  a realtor was diagnosed with breast cancer in june 2009  after having a mammogram that was deemed normal six months earlier  according to her blog densebreasttissuenet mammograms can hide  tumors in dense breasts  ones with a high percentage of breast tissue  versus fat  and salmeron told lawmakers at hearings and in personal  visits that while mammograms save lives they fail more than 20 percent  of the time to detect tumors in dense breast tissue younger women  have denser tissue than older women but about 40 percent of women  overall are believed to have dense breasts said dr sarah avery  one  of five women on a team of seven radiologists at austin radiological  association who interpret mammograms salmeron didnt know she did until her diagnosis information  about my health was kept from me she wrote on her website when i  asked why doctors dont tell women about breast density the answer is  its not standard protocol well you know what i had stage 2 breast  cancer and that is not a good enough response period  after having two lumpectomies and radiation salmeron says she considers herself lucky to be cancerfree there  is debate in the medical and scientific community on whether dense  breasts by themselves are a risk factor for breast cancer dr beth  hellerstedt  an oncologist who leads the research team at texas  oncology in central texas  is among those who believe the jury is still  out there is concern that younger people tend to have denser  breasts and if your breasts are more like rubber cement than whipped  cream it may be harder to see a tumor hellerstedt said she says more research is needed to determine whether density alone raises the risk of breast cancer avery the radiologist says density by itself is a risk factor for cancer although doctors are not sure why the  law requires facilities that perform mammograms including hospitals  to let patients know they might benefit from supplemental screening  tests if they have dense breasts and other breast cancer risk factors the facilities are not required to tell patients whether they have dense  breasts but will let them know that their prescribing doctor will have  that information if they want to pursue it avery said that austin  radiological association the largest provider of mammograms in central  texas plans to give patients a letter that restates the language in  the law but whether the notification will be handled the same at every  facility is uncertain she said thats because the notification  is the responsibility of the technical facility performing the  mammogram in many cases that will be a hospital said avery who reads  mammograms for hospitals affiliated with st davids healthcare and the  seton healthcare family the final decision will rest with each  facilitys administrators state representative ana hernandez luna   dhouston author of the legislation wrote in an email that she was  satisfied with how austin radiological was planning to follow the law this  allows one for the patient to become aware of this issue and two  allows them to take steps to discuss with their physician just exactly  what that means in each womans case hernandez luna wrote it serves  as a way to open dialogue with their physician on whether or not they  have dense breast tissue  avery said she thought the law would be  informative and potentially helpful to women but said it really needs  to be put together with the womens other risk factors  some doctors said they worry it will provoke anxiety and lead to more costly mris i  think its going to make things very complicated for the breast center  and the women said dr jane nelson an austin breast surgeon well  just have to see how it plays out  a powerful new diagnostic tool a  woman who discovers she has dense breasts might seek an mri which uses  radio waves and a powerful magnet mris are more sensitive than  mammograms or ultrasound at detecting tumors but they are more  expensive and give a higher number of false positives according to  the national cancer institute for women already diagnosed as  having a tumor a relatively new diagnostic scanning tool can help a  doctor examine the breast at the molecular level nelson invested  in a positron emission mammography or pem scanner four years ago  spending between 500000 and 1 million and has the only pem scanner  in austin according to naviscan the manufacturer pem scans show metabolic differences in tissues which indicate the extent of disease and helps inform the treatment it  is another example of personalized medicine it can also see tumors  when a womans hormone levels are high  a problem with mris nelson  said to do the scan a radioactive dye is injected to highlight  the metabolic activity of the cells cancer cells absorb and accumulate  sugar faster than healthy tissue enabling the doctor to see the size  shape and location of a mass some see the radiation as a downside pem  exposes women to much more radiation than the relatively small amount  they would get from a mammogram but its much less than they would get  from a full body and head ct scan nelson said research is under way to  cut the amount of pem radiation in half she said nelson does  not expect pem scanning to become a supplemental screening test for  women with dense breast tissue at least not anytime soon many  doctors are more comfortable with mris which dont expose patients to  radiation and there is more data supporting the use of that  longstanding technology but not all women can have an mri nelson said because of claustrophobia or body size research key to detection care someday scanning to detect and diagnose cancer might not be necessary a  vaccine to prevent breast cancer is in early stage trials said  hellerstedt who added that she is not working on it and someday a  blood test might detect breast cancer but thats not on the horizon  yet she said we need to continually look for better screening she said there is a limit to what a mammogram can tell you  in addition to the problem with breast density it sometimes takes a few years for a mammogram to detect a tumor oncologists  in the austin area said they are encouraged by the boost cancer  research received when voters in 2007 created the cancer prevention and  research institute of texas through a 3 billion state bond issue since  then the institute has awarded 283 grants for cancer research totaling  4552 million breast cancer research has received about 40 million  institute executive director bill gimson  said at a breast cancer  awareness month event in october at el buen samaritano episcopal mission  in austin researchers hope not only to get better at detecting breast cancer but also to devise better treatments we  will look at all patients to figure out what makes their tumor grow  abnormally and develop medications that can specifically address that  with the least amount of toxicity hellerstedt said we wont get rid  of chemotherapy anytime in the near future u2026 but we should be able  to target it more effectively  various drugs in latestage trials  are showing promise for extending lives including trastuzumabdm1  for  her2  positive breast cancer and pertuzumab which is combined with  herceptin and chemotherapy advances also are being made in  radiation therapy radiation regimens that typically lasted 612 weeks can  be shortened to four said dr courtney sheinbein a radiation  oncologist with texas oncology in austin and some of his   colleagues are using a targeted radiation therapy that is working out  well for certain patients with early stage breast cancer he said they  insert a tube with a small balloon into the lumpectomy cavity a  machine with a radioactive iridium 192 pellet delivers a short burst of  radiation into the balloon twice a day for a week a similar procedure  has been used to treat lung and prostate cancers sheinbein said the goal of those treatments is to improve convenience without reducing the cure rate or worsening toxicity he said doctors have no tailormade therapy for triplenegative breast cancer a  promising drug that was being tested in austin to treat that cancer  iniparib  did not meet patient survival goals and has not been approved  by the food and drug administration doctors said they have not given  up hope in that same vein women with breast cancer that has  spread  metastatic cancer  have seen advances and have a better chance  of living longer chang the houston doctor said i think we  are at a point where we understand a lot about cancer and breast cancer  is the furthest along she said

House members from Mexico come down on different sides of sanctuary...	2011-04-10	Austin American Statesman	http://www.statesman.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/house-members-from-mexico-come-down-on-different-s/nRY5s/	en	 state representatives jose aliseda and ana hernandez luna might have roots in the same    southoftheborder country but their political views are a world apart aliseda rbeeville and hernandez luna dhouston each were born in mexico    and moved to the united states as children they became citizens and hence    were able to be elected to the texas house of representatives but their    paths are as different as their political views  even on immigration a    topic the legislature soon will tackle aliseda 54 a freshman lawmaker said hes probably the most conservative of    the handful of hispanic republicans in the house and hernandez luna  32 a    house member since 2005 is one of the more liberal members in two    interestgroup scorecards she voted 100 percent with naral prochoice texas    in 2009 and 20 percent with the conservative texas eagle forum with a controversial bill barring socalled sanctuary cities in texas coming    up soon for floor debate both lawmakers said they intend to be vocal on the    measure which would prevent police departments from having policies that    prevent officers from inquiring about a persons immigration status i think people need to hear it from the perspective of an immigrant    aliseda said hernandez luna agrees and says she wants to put a face on the oftmaligned    topic of immigration i am able to understand what a lot of these immigrants are going through    because my family went through it she said the sanctuary cities bill  a priority for republican governor rick perry  will    be the first immigrationrelated bill to be debated this session some    lawmakers have said it might be the only one  or at least one of a select    few  to be brought to the floor this session making it all the more    important party leaders on both sides said the mexicoborn lawmakers  among a handful    of immigrants in the house  will make for a richer debate a democratic party leader representative jessica farrar dhouston said hernandez luna    offers a unique perspective and is an example of the good that immigrants    can do her view on immigration is expansive farrar said the houses gop caucus chair representative larry taylor rfriendswood said aliseda    demonstrates that not all hispanics have the same philosophies on    immigration he has a perspective that he can bring that someone from a different    race cant bring taylor added      aliseda is the son of an anesthesiologist and came to the us legally from    mexico city when he was 4 years old his father had a skill that the    hospital in elgin ill needed aliseda had to wait 13 years for    citizenship but he never had to live in fear of immigration agents through    legal channels he obtained residency and achieved citizenship at the age of    17 the family lived on the outskirts of chicago for much of alisedas early life eventually they moved to mcallen where aliseda finished high school he    got an english degree at the university of texas followed by a law degree he was an officer in the us navy and later he became the county judge in    bee county and served on the state board of pardons and paroles hes now a    general practice lawyer he said he sought a seat in the legislature because his predecessor was too    liberal and now that hes in the house he said hell cast an aye vote on    the sanctuary cities bill because thats what his constituents would want his vote he said would serve to protect people legally in texas both    citizens and immigrants  but also to fight illegal immigration he blames undocumented people for using state resources in hospitals housing    schools and prisons he acknowledged that many undocumented immigrants pay    for some services through sales and property taxes but said if they are paid    their wages under the table then they dont pay federal taxes much of    which comes back to texas tighter control of immigration laws is vital he said to make sure the    countrys resources are not spread too thin it wont be a wonderful place much longer because there is only so much    to go around he said the sanctuary cities bill should help he said because you cannot have    places in this state that allow illegal immigrants to live without fear of    ever being asked if they are here legally     hernandez luna takes the opposite view of the sanctuary cities bill    reflecting on a life that was much different than her former countrymates hernandez lunas parents brought her then an infant and her older sister    across the border from their home in the northern mexican city of reynosa in    1979 it was pretty much the four of us and a suitcase she said they came on a visitors visa and when it expired she said the family    stayed and lived for years in the shadows hernandez luna said her mother    was sometimes afraid of going to the grocery store for fear of an    immigration bust they settled in houston living in one room at the home of one of her fathers    cousins her father labored nights at a warehouse and her mother worked at    a western wear store later the family also ran a mexican restaurant on the    weekends as a beneficiary of immigration reform in 1986 hernandez luna became a    citizen at age 18 and then qualified for scholarship programs she went to    the university of houston and later to the university of texas for law    school while a student she became an intern at the legislature under a    program by state senator rodney ellis dhouston  now a civil practice lawyer hernandez luna said she can see herself in some    young immigrants and she wants to use her office to help them i see other ana hernandez lunas out there that given the opportunity to    excel i think they will she said i think there are a lot of    immigrants out there that are willing to work hard know that there are    sacrifices that need to be made but need to be given an opportunity  hernandez luna will be a no vote on the sanctuary cities bill she    said it would open the door to racial profiling and push more people into    the shadows    for all the political fighting between democrats and republicans over    immigration there is some common ground and hernandez luna and aliseda    share some basic beliefs most notably they both said they have a concern for the people in texas living    in the shadows a term they both used both lawmakers want the border secured a job they agree should be shouldered    by the federal government they part ways on what to do with the undocumented people already here hernandez luna said she would like to see a workers permit program and a    path to citizenship aliseda said he could support a policy to help some lawabiding and    assimilated undocumented people stay in the country though he doesnt favor    a blanket amnesty program they need to respect this country and want to be americans he    said but until the federal government can secure the border the    republicancontrolled house will take a swing at immigrationrelated    lawmaking and the house will take up the sanctuary cities bill just as the    governor wants it will pass in all likelihood along party lines and in the end both aliseda and hernandez luna will go home to their    districts after the vote and each will say they fought for their    constituents and for texas teatonstatesmancom 4742993

Legislature shifts gears on immigration	2013-02-15	Austin American Statesman	http://www.statesman.com/news/news/opinion/legislature-shifts-gears-on-immigration/nWQSZ/	en	there is a shift in both the rhetoric and approach to immigration that is both noticeable and welcome this legislative session missing is the hyperbolic rhetoric that spewed out of the capitol any time immigration legal or otherwise was mentioned members were elbowing each other out of the way to file legislation that supposedly cracked down on illegal immigration but on closer examination proved nothing more than empty posturing the noise got so loud that the states business owners expressed concern a bill filed by state representative debbie riddle rtomball proposing sanctions for employers who hire illegal immigrants grabbed the states business community by its lapels bill hammond who leads the texas association of business spoke up in opposition the bill didnt go anywhere so far this session riddle filed a number of bills but nothing relating to immigration remember that donothing but immensely popular sanctuary cities bill introduced during both the regular and special sessions in 2011 leo berman rtyler sponsored the bill in the house it passed during the regular session but died in the senate it was revived in the special session in the senate but died in the house nobody took the rap for the bills demise but superlobbyists bill miller and buddy jones were dispatched by business clients who had some reservations about the bill to see about it those clients included home builder bob perry  a mega contributor to conservative causes and candidates  and grocery store magnate charles butt next thing you know a bill that had passed both chambers  albeit at different times  and apparently enjoying good health was dead by the way berman lost his reelection bid to matt schaefer an ally of house speaker joe straus bermans departure left the post of chief immigrant basher open but so far no one appears willing to claim it whether thats a sign of intellectual evolution on a complex issue in the legislature or acquiescence to the political realities of displeasing powerful business interests is a matter of interpretation the national republican party is moving toward finding a positive path through the immigration thicket rather than simply fulminating about it both democratic and republican legislators are working on resolutions on immigration that recommend securing the borders but also include guest worker programs and even pathways to citizenship that mirrors the recent federal bipartisan push for immigration reform proposed recently by eight democratic and gop senators including marco rubio the florida republican who delivered a response to president barack obamas state of the union speech earlier this week as we have expressed on this page many times before the united states government has both the obligation and the right to secure its borders but an enforcementonly approach to immigration matters inevitably will come up short a realistic approach to immigration involves a variety of methods to encourage people to enter the country legally whether to work or to study texans should be at the forefront of a search for positive solutions the state has the longest stretch of border with mexico  roughly 1000 of the 2000 miles so texas reaps both the problems and benefits associated with legal and illegal immigration that makes the texas stake in the immigration debate a big one and should be an incentive for both state and federal elected officials to contribute ideas of substance and not bluster to the discussion earlier this week agriculture commissioner todd staples worked with gop legislators on a resolution aimed at reforming our workforce immigration system maintaining our current pathways for citizenship securing our borders and ending the shadow economy by providing legal work status for the millions currently living here illegally said a statement issued by bryan black his communications director meanwhile state representatives state representatives rafael anchia ddallas and ana hernandez luna dhouston filed a resolution asking congress to enact comprehensive immigration reform that contains a path to citizenship anchia said he would reach out to the house republican caucus and open up the resolution to joint authorship nobody should expect total agreement on all aspects of the immigration issue but it is heartening to see that differences can be addressed respectfully and positively

William McKenzie: Don't we want ambitious, assimilated immigrants ...	2011-05-15	DALLAS MORNING NEWS	http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/columnists/william-mckenzie/20110516-william-mckenzie-dont-we-want-ambitious-assimilated-immigrants.ece	en	even as president barack obama was speaking last week in el paso about moving beyond border security to overhauling our immigration system the texas house was approving a bill that would make it against the law for texas cities to give sanctuary to illegal immigrants the coincidental timing of speech and vote was a study in contrasts to say the least no surprise that i think obamas right about why we need to start dealing with the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants living in the us today not to mention the thousands more who want to come here tomorrow but i doubt any amount of data about how immigrants contribute say to the economy will win over skeptics facts about why we should create a new immigration system have been out there since before obamas predecessor george w bush tried to overhaul the system so instead we need to deal with the raw emotions that color this debate and keep us from getting off deadcenter the emotions are on all sides often for understandable reasons and beyond simple immigration they mostly have to do with illegal immigrants some americans paint them as bad actors because they came here illegally or overstayed their visas some further believe that bad acting extends to committing crimes and taking advantage of taxpayers but those stuck on the badactor argument need to come up with an answer about what we do with people like ana hernandez luna whos not anything like that devious character hernandez luna is a democratic state representative from houston last week after texas legislators passed the sanctuary city bill she called for a moment of personal privilege on the house floor she used the time to tell her colleagues that she had been an illegal immigrant she came to the us as a young girl with her mexican parents all had visas but as with so many illegal immigrants they overstayed their papers not until she was 9 she said did she and her family come out of the shadows  that was when they met with officials after president ronald reagan signed a law that made it possible for illegal immigrants to step forward without prosecution hernandez luna went on to high school in pasadena graduated from the university of houston and earned her law degree from the university of texas as she detailed her journey on the house floor she choked up i would too if i had experienced that arc when i spoke with her later in the week she said she had been aware as a child that she and her family had overstayed their visas when they wanted to see family still living in mexico they would have to meet them at the border otherwise she and her sister and their parents could not return to the us remember those emotions heres where many folks go ballistic they had no right to be here in the first place  but stop for a moment and think about the path ana hernandez luna now 32 has taken since becoming a permanent resident and then a citizen she has earned two degrees become proficient in english and risen up to help decide laws for the state of texas none of that would have been possible without the us giving her a chance to join mainstream society more than any data point or presidential speech one life shows what can happen when people are given a chance to make it and thats why hernandez luna gave her floor speech she told me that some of her colleagues have a certain perception of illegal immigrants she wanted them to see a colleague who had been one and how that illegal immigrant turned out its only one anecdote but her story does raise this question what do we do with people like ana hernandez luna ambitious and eager to assimilate into american life william mckenzie is a dallas morning news editorial columnist and moderates texas faith at dallasnewscomtexasfaith and the education front at dallasnewscomeducationfront his email is wmckenziedallasnewscom

Sylvester Turner's Exit Leaves Void for Democrats	2015-05-10	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2015/05/10/turners-departure-leaves-democrats-less-clout/	en	clarification appended in 2003 state representative sylvester turner of houston made the most definitive decision of his political career turner had arrived in the texas house 14 years earlier when he and his fellow democrats outnumbered republicans 91 to 59 gib lewis was speaker and democrats still ran the show but by 2003 the tide hadnt just turned against democrats  it was running away without them republicans took the chambers majority for the first time in more than a century democrat pete laney the previous sessions speaker was about to become just another member and tom craddick was poised to take the top post reading the political winds turner led a group of democrats who became known as the craddick ds who cast their support behind the midland conservative in hopes of salvaging some level of access and influence it was a pivotal moment for turner and some in his party were not at all happy with him but as turner prepares to leave the house after more than a quarter century that decision captures the politicians essence  a savvy personability that allowed him to emerge as a democratic pillar in the republicancontrolled house the 60yearold harvard law school graduate is running for mayor of his hometown a post hes unsuccessfully sought before his expected departure from the house will leave a gaping hole that house democrats will be hardpressed to fill wellrespected and liked by members of both parties turner now the sixth most senior house member has managed to snap up positions on prominent committees and hold on to his place at important negotiating tables hes the vice chairman of the house appropriations committee which drafts the chambers budget and was the only democrat to lead a budget subcommittee hes also a longtime member of the powerful state affairs committee which takes up farreaching measures on social issues and spent several years on the calendars committee which sets the daily calendar of bills to be considered by the lower chamber i think democrats lose important institutional knowledge said democratic state representative mary gonzlez of clint who described turners departure as devastating i think we lose a mentor a friend and someone who united us in multiple ways  losing turners ability to serve as a bridge builder within his party  and between republicans and democrats  will be felt the most gonzlez added turner whose influence is seldom hobbled by showmanship deflects the significance of his departure the texas house the texas senate and the legislature was in existence way before i came and itll be in existence a long time after im gone he said during a recent interview in his capitol office turner attributed his success to becoming fluent in house rules learning the ins and outs of the legislative process and making himself valuable to leadership because even when you find yourself in the minority  numerically speaking  the process sometimes becomes the equalizer he said another effective turner tool however has been intense but pragmatic floor speeches that prompt some to call him the conscience of the house  at the podium hes studious almost professorial asking questions as he peers at a bills author over his thinrimmed glasses oftentimes he takes those speeches to committee hearing rooms during a state affairs hearing in april during which the committee considered an antigay marriage measure turner grilled a witness over his remarks about state sovereignty overruling decisions by the us supreme court i believe in following the dictates and the processes that are outlined by our system turner said there are times when we will agree there are times when we wont agree but the only point that im making is there has to be processes by way which we follow the law otherwise we have total anarchy  other times he opts for brevity after an hourslong floor debate on allowing the open carry of handguns turner took to the mic to speak in opposition just before a final vote his remarks were short really  robert eckels a former republican representative from houston whose terms overlapped with turner said turners institutional knowledge and disposition helped him fit in with conservatives its more the politics of personality than it is the politics of party eckels said you can have philosophical differences and vote your district but still be influential in the process sylvester has managed to maintain that type of relationship with his colleagues  but for all the close ties turner cultivated with republican leadership he also faced criticism from members of his own party the craddick ds were considered traitors by some democrats and their votes in support of the speaker made them targets for primary challengers jim dunnam a former democratic state representative from waco who led the charge against craddick said its arguable that bipartisan relations in the house improved when various democrats were inside the craddick tent but some democrats clearly benefited from it sylvester has always been a very astute politician and i think an argument could be made that he was able to assist his district by maintaining those positions dunnam said turner acknowledged that group dynamics are an important part of the house despite tactical disagreements there will be times when we may differ on strategy and we may go different ways but i think on balance when we have stayed together i think weve worked well he said some democrats anticipate itll take a group effort to fill the hole turner will leave others point to veteran house members like senfronia thompson and garnet coleman both also houston democrats among those who will continue carrying the mantle democratic state representative armando walle of houston who serves on appropriations with turner said it will be incumbent on other democrats to step up  something made easier by turners willingness to advise newer members this is a relay race and hes a strong leg on that race walle said chairman turner is one of the strong anchor legs but at the same time some of us have to pick up the baton and learn from him  vowing not to return to the house even if he loses the mayors race for a third time turner insists hes not worried about new champions coming forward given house democrats young talent  he points to the likes of gonzlez walle and ana hernandez dhouston i think we run the risk of assuming the institution wont survive without us turner said adding hed prefer to leave the house while his constituents still want him to stay invariably people will step up thats been the history and i dont see that changing  clarification this story has been updated to reflect that the timeline for representative sylvester turners departure from the house has not been set our daily news

House Resolution to Test Support for Immigration Reform	2013-02-13	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2013/02/13/house-resolution-test-support-immigration-reform/	en	updated 450 pm  a spokesman for agriculture commissioner todd staples said on wednesday his office was also working with legislators on drafting a resolution that has broad support among legislators border sheriffs and the business community  among the principles commissioner staples is advocating are reforming our workforce immigration system maintaining our current pathways for citizenship securing our borders and ending the shadow economy by providing legal work status for the millions currently living here illegally bryan black the communications director for the office said in a statement staples was to hold a press conference with state senator craig estes rwichita falls the chairman of the senate committee on agriculture rural affairs and homeland security on wednesday morning that press conference was canceled anchia said he was approached by state representative byron cook rcorsicana who was also working with staples on the resolution but that there was no nefarious intent to undermine the republicans efforts or file his resolution sooner i was clear with byron cook that ana hernandez and i were filing something today he said i think it was more a coincidence  anchia said he did not read a draft and would reserve judgment on it until he could take a closer look but he was willing to work with republicans to gain their support for his measure in a statement wednesday staples lauded the efforts of anchia and hernandez luna though he disagreed with creating a pass to citizenship for those already in the country illegally i applaud the members for working on solutions and for incorporating some of the work texas republicans are doing to repair the workforce immigration system staples said in order for responsible immigration reform to be successful we must reject political gamesmanship that seeks to invent alternative pathways to citizenship and instead focus on ending a shadow economy that is unjust to both those who are undocumented and to all americans  staples added it is time for the federal government to do its part to secure our border and fix the broken immigration system that threatens american sovereignty and economic prosperity  we have a call in to cooks office and will update this post when we hear back original story democratic texas house members on wednesday filed an immigration resolution that could serve as a litmus test for republican support for reforms being suggested at the national level house concurrent resolution 44 which urges the us congress to swiftly enact and fund comprehensive immigration reform that creates a road map to citizenship comes after president obamas tuesday state of the union address where he again pushed congress to craft a bill to address the 11 million to 12 million people living in the country illegally and to repair the nations existing immigration system filed by state representatives rafael anchia ddallas and ana hernandez luna dhouston it incorporates statistics from the texas comptroller the cato institute and the partnership for a new american economy and statements of support for immigration reform from former state representatives john garza rsan antonio and raul torres rcorpus christi and the texas federation of republican women as well as a national reform framework authored by a bipartisan group of us senators anchia said he wanted the resolution to have some substance and make a strong statement that texas can lead the way on immigration reform according to a poll of 1000 voters conducted by public opinion strategies a republican polling firm and hart research associates a democratic firm a solid 77 percent of voters favor a full package of immigration reform anchia said in a statement hernandez luna said it was time for others to benefit from the opportunity to come out of the shadows an experience she knows firsthand during the debate over the controversial sanctuary cities proposal two years ago hernandez luna gave a tearful speech about how she was an undocumented immigrant until immigration reform was passed under president ronald reagans administration as an immigrant i can relate to all of these families she said on wednesday i was undocumented for eight years  she went on to graduate high school at 16 and attend law school after college she was first elected to the texas house when she was 27 none of that would have been possible without immigration reform in 1986 she added anchia said he would reach out to the house republican caucus and open up the resolution to joint authorship he said the timing was ideal after seeing that lawmakers in texas were unwilling to pass divisive statebased immigration measures similar to bills passed in arizona and alabama texas has resisted that and i am proud of the state for having done that he said if we do not keep momentum going and it fails i worry we wont be able to get anything accomplished for a long long time  the resolution states that according to a 2006 study conducted by the comptroller the deportation of the millions of texans in the state illegally would have resulted in a loss to the states gross domestic product of 18 billion figures from the cato institute indicate an overhaul of the countrys immigration system would add an additional 15 trillion to the countrys gdp the resolution echoes what both parties have said needs to occur before a major overhaul of the old system can occur  fully securing the border that language has irked some border leaders who say the border is already secure and allege that elected officials who live far away from the area should not be dictating border security policy el paso county judge veronica escobar said this week that the rhetoric hurts legal trade and migration and paints the border in a bad light i agree with the judge that the border is secure anchia said i hear from all opinion leaders that say progress has been made that language is in there because that continues to be an issue to our friends

Guest Column: Obama's Immigration Policy is Correct	2012-06-25	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2012/06/25/guest-column-living-dream/	en	two years after the dream act failed to pass in congress hundreds of thousands of young immigrants in america dreamers finally have the opportunity to live the american dream they were brought to this country by their parents in search for a better life and opportunity like parents all over the world they want the best for their children for years these young immigrants have lived in our country and have learned the american way of life but have lived in the shadows they have been taught that obtaining an education pays off but have yet to see the fruits of their hard work as they live in undocumented status on june 15 president obama announced that certain young immigrants will be eligible to receive deferred deportation action and will be eligible to apply for work authorization permits for young dreamers this means that after living in this country for the majority of their lives they will finally be able to have a career and will no longer have to live in fear of being deported to a country they do not know and separated from their family this is the humane thing to do as these young people are americans in every sense of the word except they dont have a piece of paper stating that they are american like many young immigrants i am elated over president obamas executive order i share in their joy because i was once in their position although i was too young at the time to fully comprehend the lifechanging effect the immigration reform and control act of 1986 had for many families i remember our familys excitement to know that we would finally be able to come out of the shadows and no longer have to live in fear of being deported i believe it was at this point that my lifes path took a new direction after becoming a naturalized citizen i continued to work hard in my studies earning a scholarship to attend and graduate from the university of houston i graduated from the university of texas law school my commitment to public service has taken me to my current office of state representative all this became possible because of bipartisan comprehensive immigration policy this new immigration policy will also change the path for hundreds of thousands of young immigrants albeit temporary the presidents executive order will provide relief to approximately 800000 young immigrants that do not have criminal histories and are currently in school have graduated from high school have obtained their geds or are honorably discharged veterans of the coast guard or armed forces of the united states many dreamers have already obtained their college degrees but are unable to utilize their skills and training because of their undocumented status by allowing these individuals to obtain work authorization permits our local state and national economies will benefit there will be the benefit of having an increase in our taxable income base when these individuals are allowed to practice in their trained professions and an increase in jobs when the entrepreneurs are allowed to open businesses that create additional jobs throughout the many visits i have made to schools and community gatherings across the state of texas i have met many outstanding young men and women who are products of our public schools and universities but cannot seek employment because of their legal status i have met valedictorians honors graduates engineers teachers architects and nurses who live in the shadows even though there may be a need for their skill or trade dreamers have worked tirelessly urging our federal leaders to give them a chance and finally their voices have been heard and action is being taken in contrast the republican approach and proposed solution to our broken immigration system has been simply focusing on increasing deportations in support of their position they have looked to arizona and alabama as practical solutions to immigration our immigration problem is not a simple problem that can be fixed with nothing more than deportations the republicans take the position that changes in immigration policy that will provide relief for young college educated students will encourage illegal immigration they ignore the fact that immigration is driven by supply and demand for cheap labor that demand has dropped off significantly in recent years and is reflected by a sharp decrease in immigration comprehensive immigration policy must address all facets of this issue while this new immigration policy is a small step in the right direction it changes the focus of our nations immigration policy towards the ultimate goal of comprehensive immigration reform we cannot continue to ignore the problems in our broken immigration system i applaud president obama for doing the right thing and giving these young people the opportunity to succeed ana hernandez luna dhouston is serving her third term in the texas house of representatives representing district 143 
Rare Swing Seat Sparks Two Hot Primaries in HD-144	2012-05-17	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2012/05/17/rare-swing-seat-sparks-two-hot-primaries/	en	pasadena texas  its one of the ills of modern american politics most legislative seats are drawn in a way that heavily favors either a republican or a democrat southeast texas house district 144 though is about as close to a tossup as they come according to the texas weekly index which gauges the partisan tilt of districts it is arguably the most competitive house seat in texas it leans democratic but just barely not surprisingly there are contested primaries on both sides to fill the seat representative ken legler rpasadena decided to retire rather than run in the heavily redrawn district now overwhelmingly hispanic there are three democratic candidates fighting for their partys nomination making a runoff likely two candidates neither of whom has held public office are running for the gop nomination if money and endorsements are any guide mary ann perez is the democratic frontrunner a trustee of the houston community college governing board perez has racked up the support of virtually all the major state democratic elected officials in and around the district including sens mario gallegos john whitmire and rodney ellis all houston democrats im definitely the most experienced and i definitely have the most endorsements said perez who owns a farmers insurance agency branch im hoping to win without a runoff finances are coming in nicely  at last count she had 40700 in the bank more than any other candidate on either side perez 50 raised 48000 from january to midapril and spent 20000 over the same period pasadena city council member ornaldo ybarra 33 says that perez is the choice of the establishment and thats fine with him the former us marine says he will make up with energy and enthusiasm any institutional support that other candidates may have besides serving on the city council he is a police officer and swat team member at the pearland police department do you want somebody in austin that is still in touch with the working class and the people i think im it ybarra said all youve got in austin is lawyers and insurance people and consultants  ybarra has spent 7500 on the race since january and had only 2678 in the bank as of midapril reports show kevin risner who has deep political ties to the district is also seeking the democratic nomination risner 31 is the son of longtime justice of the peace george risner and he is counting on support from labor unions to help him across the finish line risner predicts less than 2000 voters will pick the next democratic nominee and he says he has a pretty good idea which ones will turn out to vote and he is focusing heavily on them weve got a real good strategy in place he said but risner could have trouble winning the seat in the fall if he emerges victorious in the may 29 primary or the july 31 runoff he is sure to face criticism over the three dwis  in 1999 2005 and 2007  which he acknowledges he has gotten risner pleaded guilty to the first one and was convicted twice after that the criminal history came to light in a blog written by lobbyist robert miller who is supporting perez miller said risner is a strong contender thanks to goodwill for his father and because ybarra and perez are likely to split the hispanic vote but he warned risner might be a fatally flawed candidate in a general election i suspect the republicans will be licking their chops to face him in the general election miller said risner said the airing of his criminal record was unfortunate but he admits he made some mistakes in the past  i fixed what needed to be fixed and thats all i have to say risner said district 144 is 70 percent hispanic and latinos make up about 48 percent of the registered voters john mccain beat barack obama 51 percent48 percent there in the 2008 presidential election but in 2010 former houston mayor bill white beat governor rick perry in the district 53 percent45 percent in other words its a swing seat one of about 10 that will be up for grabs in november so for democrats its a prime pickup opportunity while republicans are playing defense to try to hang on to the seat two hispanics are fighting for the republican nomination one of them gilbert pea 62 retired from his job as a commercial refrigerator installer has run unsuccessfully for office twice before  in 2008 against gallegos and in 2010 against representative ana hernandez luna dhouston he said he considered running against gallegos in the democratic primary but began some soulsearching about his party affiliation he read both party platforms from cover to cover and much to my surprise i was a republican he said im trying to convert that hispanic vote into republican he said right now they tend to vote democrat  pea reported a cashonhand balance of zero in april and had spent just 3200 in the last three and a half months by contrast former us marine david pineda 28 had almost 20000 in the bank as of midapril and had spent 6600 since january pineda a substitute teacher at the pasadena independent school district has lined up highprofile support from state senator dan patrick rhouston and the political arms of groups like texans for lawsuit reform and the texas association of business he said his worldwide experience serving abroad with the marines make him an ideal candidate to win his primary and then a competitive general election ive always wanted to serve ive got a record of serving pineda said im committed to all the way through the end and i think im well positioned  texas tribune donors or members may be quoted or mentioned in our stories or may be the subject of them for a

Perry's TWIA Nemesis Promises to Continue His Fight	2011-07-06	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2011/07/06/perrys-twia-nemesis-promises-to-continue-his-fight/	en	hes the trial lawyer republican governor rick perry loves to hate steve mostyn from the small east texas town of whitehouse founder of one of the states largest plaintiffs firms single biggest political donor in the 2010 state elections top financier of lost democratic causes mostyn gave about 10 million in 2010 much of it aimed at defeating perry and nearly all of it going to democrats about the only thing he has to show for it now though is the ire of a powerful  and in mostyns words vindictive   texas governor and possible presidential candidate in the marathon lawmaking session that just ended a perryversusmostyn fight concluded with the trial lawyer on the losing end of an argument over how much money attorneys like him could make from storm insurance claims he may have lost this fight but hes not giving up the war mostyn said he is making plans to create a national political action committee so he can keep gathering opposition research on perry and dog him through any possible presidential bid perry spokesman mark miner said the governor is undeterred by mostyns sustained money bomb campaign people can see behind the rhetoric and the millions of dollars that he spends against the governor miner said he has an agenda which is to help liberal trial lawyers it was unsuccessful during the governors race and it was unsuccessful during the session  dogging perry is a strategy mostyn is familiar with but one that so far has paid little dividends mostyn paid for those controversial fullpage newspaper ads calling perry a coward for refusing to debate democrat bill white in 2010 he also dipped into his personal fortune to run a series of negative tv ads against the governor and he funneled millions into political action committees opposed to the gop conservative agenda perry won 5542 percent the fight didnt end in november it spilled into the regular and special sessions of the texas legislature and when they concluded perry had helped oversee a highly contentious overhaul of the rules governing stormrelated lawsuits  the kind that helped make mostyn a multimillionaire perry said the reforms were needed to stop trial lawyers like mostyn from depleting a statebacked insurance fund known as the texas windstorm insurance association or twia perry said they were treating the state insurer of last resort like a personal atm  mostyn calls the outcome  twia reforms that reduce damages awarded to policyholders and sharply limit lawsuits by storm victims  political revenge in an interview with the tribune mostyn said perry and the republicanled legislature in their zeal to punish him instead put coastal insurance policyholders in the crosshairs he said hell still make millions though perhaps not by suing insurance companies after devastating storms like hurricanes rita and ike he said policyholders along the coast in particular will be shocked to see what their winddamage insurance now covers and he predicted attorneys will essentially now quit taking twia cases under current law policyholders who can prove that twia intentionally failed to honor a claim can win up to three times the amount of damages caused by a storm and penalties on those damages can accrue at a rate of 18 percent per year the new law allows wronged claimants up to twice the damages the storm caused and reduces the penalty amount to zero im unfortunately the reason that policyholders of this state are going to be stuck with the worst insurance law regarding any windstorm insurance company flood or any other type of insurance  in the country mostyn said its just straightup vendetta politics  the reform debate naturally pitted the texas trial lawyers association which mostyn leads as president against texans for lawsuit reform arguably the most influential business lobby group in republicanruled texas that groups chief lobbyist is mike toomey perrys former chief of staff longtime friend and confidante perry and gop lawmakers supported by tlr came into the regular legislative session determined to limit how much money twia pays out as a result of major hurricanes and the number of claims policyholders can file lawmakers said they worried the agency was on the brink of bankruptcy especially after hurricane ike in all the agency has so far paid about 19 billion to 93000 homeowners affected by ike now twia has about 100 million in cash and the capability to issue 25 billion in bonds it also has about 636 million in reinsurance thats not nearly enough they argued with weather experts predicting a busy hurricane season ahead tlr and their gop backers focused on the millions trial lawyers have made from claims and lawsuits against twia and on the fact that if the agency ran out of money insurance policyholders from all over texas would have to pay more into the insurance pool to cover storm losses we just dont have enough money to go around state representative john smithee ramarillo chairman of the house insurance committee and lead twia negotiator for the lower chamber said during debate on the house floor democrats and other coastal lawmakers pointed to alleged malfeasance and fraud perpetrated by the windstorm association critics say emails exchanged among twia officials show a pattern of deliberate fraud an orchestrated effort to limit payouts to storm victims in one email obtained by mostyns firm for example twia claims supervisor christina turner writes to her superiors to warn that the agency was acting in bad faith by not following procedures for settling claims we are basically refusing to pay a claim without conducting a reasonable investigation this is a classaction lawsuit in the making turner wrote in january 2009 according to mostyn law firm attorney andrew taylor turner was escorted off the property and fired shortly after writing that email john polak twias interim general manager would only confirm that turner worked as a contractor for the agency from oct 1 2008 to jan 19 2009 instead of reining in the abuses mostyn and some coastal lawmakers worry the law will make it harder for policyholders to hold twia accountable in court if it doesnt honor its policies and that it will eliminate classaction lawsuits brought by private attorneys mostyn also said texans who have twia policies now or who buy them before the law takes effect will be misled into thinking they have better coverage than the new law will give them once the law goes into effect he said it impacts all twia policies both existing ones and new accounts during the highprofile squabbling over twia bill mostyn said it became clear that his direct involvement in the negotiations had become a source of tension in the governors office mostyn said he never talked to perry but was told the governor wanted him out of the negotiations taking place behind the senate chambers where mostyn and perrys chief legislative liaison ken armbrister were among those working on hammering out a compromise bill he was so entrenched on getting me  that was causing them to not be willing to focus on anything in these negotiations other than me mostyn said at one point in late may as the regular legislative session was winding down mostyn said all sides had agreed to a compromise deal but perry said there was never a deal because he hadnt signed off and one of the chief sticking points was that mostyn needed to get out of the room having mostyn as a lead negotiator has been a bad idea from the get go perry told reporters at the time after negotiations melted down state senator john carona rdallas chairman of the senate business and commerce committee said perrys staff had initially approved of the deal but reconsidered because the governor was concerned it didnt do enough to limit lawyer profits frustrated carona said at the time he had spent hundreds of hours trying to negotiate a compromise between perry and mostyn theres a little too much bravado on all sides of this issue right now carona said in a may interview theres no denying this is becoming a very personal matter between two very powerful individuals  and carona said he warned mostyn and the trial lawyers that they would not fare as well during a special legislative session because perry would have even more ability to push his proposal through the legislature without the senates twothirds rule in place the stalemate continued though and a special legislative ensued as perry promised as the squabble continued a frustrated ar babe schwartz watched intently the former democratic state senator from galveston lived through hurricane celia in 1970 and wrote the law that created twia in the wake of celia  a category 3 storm that killed 15 people and caused more than 450 million in damages  many insurers stopped writing policies for coastal homeowners in 1971 schwartz and other lawmakers created twia to provide coverage private companies would not the association is a pool of private property and casualty insurers that covers wind hail and storm damage for homeowners in 14 coastal counties and parts of harris county how much each insurance company pays into the pool depends on a number of factors including the geographic breakdown of their own policyholders in short every texan who pays for insurance pays into twia to some extent to help coastal residents recover from a catastrophe this is not brain surgery schwartz said of the highpitched complex negotiations that lawmakers endured this year weve done it before  schwartz is now a lobbyist and he represents the galveston windstorm action committee he sat through hours of committee hearings testified about what the reform proposals would mean for coastal residents and pleaded with lawmakers to boot out the special interests from the negotiating process the folks who were forgotten among all the lawyer infighting schwartz said were the texans who live on the coast who stand to lose their homes and businesses when twia fails to live up to its policy contracts theyre not going to twia because its the best policy they can get schwartz said its the only policy they can get  mostyn said critics have greatly exaggerated his role in the negotiations and have inflated how much he made off twia specifically and storms more generally he said he made about 53 million for his role in a classaction lawsuit against twia and mostyn said twia cases were only about 16 percent of his hurricane claims business  most of it from ike mostyn is believed to be worth more than 100 million but he wouldnt give a precise figure no individual gave more money than mostyn in the 2010 elections according to news reports and figures from the texas ethics commission he spent about 4 million on the back to basics group which  ran the coward ads and others taking aim at perrys alleged highliving at a rental mansion west of austin and various policy controversies mostyn also gave millions collectively to loosely connected liberal or democraticleaning groups such as the house democratic campaign committee and texans for insurance reform mostyn has not only given democrats and liberal lobby groups money but has given jobs and legal work to members of the legislature representative trey martinez fischer dsan antonio who argued passionately against the twia bill as a lawmaker was of counsel to the mostyn firm for three years he said his work for mostyn ended in september representative ana hernandez luna dhouston worked for mostyns firm for two and a half years leaving in february 2010 she said both said they helped mostyn on nontwia storm cases involving spanishspeaking policyholders the laws that we pass around here impact everybody the same martinez fischer said two other legislators have done work for mostyn one of them former representative jim dunnam dwaco was defeated in 2010 but continues to do referral work from mostyn representative craig eiland dgalveston made 627000 for his part in a classaction lawsuit against twia and he has corepresented hundreds of plaintiffs with mostyn including in cases against twia cases and some against private insurers eiland played a leading role during house debate on the twia bill arguing passionately and often fruitlessly for changes that would give policyholders a more direct path to a jury trial he told the tribune that as a citizen legislator and lawyer from the coast he saw no reason to step aside and recuse himself from a debate that could impact most of his galveston district  including his own law practice this applies to almost every one of my constituents i do the state rep job for six out of every 24 months when i represent local businesses and homeowners at the courthouse its not some backroom deal eiland said its done in public at the courthouse  i have not tried to hide it up here by the same token there is nobody in the legislature who knows more about how this bill will impact coastal residents than me  mostyn said he does not have any state legislators on his payroll currently but he wouldnt rule it out in the future thats because of the fact that its good for the business in what im doing not to do with what theyre doing on politics or votes on the floor mostyn said those guys vote their districts and their districts are aligned with trial lawyers and theres no need for me to hire folks whose districts are already in line with my causes  despite watching most of his political money go down the drain last year mostyn said he is ready to spend more as perry steps out on the national stage in a possible run for the white house mostyn said he plans to make available some of the research he has pulled together on perry as reporters begin diving into his record in texas we have plenty of information that well be happy to share with anybody mostyn said i will remain politically active  meanwhile mostyns detractors at tlr who have built a website called the truth about steve mostyn are sure to keep shining the spotlight on him too mr mostyn has a huge personal stake financially in legislation impacting the civil justice system especially all matters related to the texas windstorm insurance association said tlr

                          'Dead' voter controversy raises even more concern         	2012-10-02	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://www.chron.com//news/politics/article/Dead-voter-controversy-raises-even-more-concern-3913984.php	en	voters in traditionally africanamerican neighborhoods were disproportionately affected when harris county officials notified 9000 people their registrations could be cancelled unless they proved they were not deceased according to a chronicle analysis of data obtained from the texas secretary of state already 32 percent of voters who received are you dead  letters across the county in september  just six weeks before the presidential elections  have confirmed they are very much alive election officials said this week because of widespread complaints no county voters will be purged before the november elections unless their deaths are independently confirmed according to don sumners the countys tax assessor collector and voter registrar the chronicles analysis showed that voters living in black districts  specifically created by lawmakers to enhance political representation of blacks on the county commission and the texas legislature  received more letters than voters in other districts nearly 2900 live in harris county commissioners precinct 1  a minority op   portunity district created more than two decades ago that includes most of the countys historically black neighborhoods neutral party needed in an emailed statement precinct 1 commissioner e franco lee the only africanamerican on the harris county commissioners court said he hasnt seen as many election problems in the 27 years hes been in office  lee said he intends to solicit help from the harris county attorneys office and the us attorney to investigate the recent mistakes let me know that we need a neutral party to look into the matter and thats the us department of justice he said 70000 names  according to us census estimates africanamericans represent 19 percent of the votingage population in harris county the recent mailings were prompted by a state law effective in september 2011 that required the secretary of state to compare social security death data to voter records to help clean voter rolls statewide as part of the process state officials sent 70000 names of possibly dead voters to voter registration officials across texas however each county used the lists differently harris county officials contacted every voter listed while others did more research and sent fewer letters a moral tragedy  rev reginald lillie president of the houston naacp said faulty mass mailings just six weeks before the election erodes voter confidence our confidence in our county and our state officials to hold this election has been diminished were really concerned about texas and its a tragedy its a moral tragedy lillie said the trust factor and the credibility is just gone this should be of concern to  all texans  this is not a democratic issue this is a civil rights issue  this is a constitutional right no one should be able to stand by and think this doesnt affect them its part of the fabric of this society  in travis county voters contacted by mistake filed a lawsuit to block proposed purges because of that litigation rich parsons a spokesman for the secretary of state said he could not comment tuesday as of oct1 only 7 percent of the purported dead voters in harris county had been confirmed though hes been critical of the states decision to send out so many weak matches sumners told the chronicle that the process of comparing names dates of birth and identification numbers in voter records and social security death data was race neutral he suggested any disproportionate impact might relate to the aging of voters in historically black neighborhoods most likely to be tagged across texas voters named smith johnson williams jones brown davis garcia and rodriguez were most likely to be tagged as possibly deceased in the recent cleanup effort the chronicles analysis of all 70000 voters identified as weak matches shows some surnames are particularly common among africanamericans about  13000 voters listed had last names associated with hispanic heritage according to a list maintained by the us census bureau reform quickly okd  despite the problems with cleanup attempts the 2011 reform attracted no opposition in legislative hearings and was quickly approved by the justice department key lawmakers said the reform needs more work our election administrators need to ensure that properly registered voters arent being purged erroneously just as much as they need to ensure that votes arent being cast for people who are deceased said representative larry taylor rfriendswood the house elections committee chair representative ana hernandez luna dhouston the committees vice chair said corrective measures must be considered adding were all in support of maintaining rolls that are clean and uptodate but not at the peril of disenfranchising eligible voters  liseolsenchroncom
At the Lege, Age Matters; Seniority May Not	2010-05-19	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2010/05/19/at-the-lege-age-matters-seniority-may-not/	en	when state representative joe straus rsan antonio was elected to lead the texas house in january 2009 he shook the political ladder illustrating a key difference between the way things are done in austin and the way theyre done in washington dc  seniority is important here but its not the beallendall it is in the nations capital straus immediately moved out of positions of authority veteran lawmakers who were against him  mostly from his own party  and replaced many of them with people of his own legislative generation not his own age mind you his own legislative age straus is 50 years old but hes only been in the house for three sessions the speaker is part of a youth movement of sorts he has promoted younger and less tenured committee chairs resignations the primary elections in march and the runoffs in april took out 15 members of the house  13 of them with 11 or more years of experience and six of those with 17 years or more some of the new members might have some years on them but theyll be new to the legislature and some of them are young enough that they could stay a while as it stands the texas legislature has 21 democrats under the age of 40 and five republicans younger than 40 the average age of democrats in the legislature is 50 the average age of republicans is 57 the average male is younger than the average female by two years the average hispanic is 45 the average anglo is 56 and the average african american is 59 the oldest members by age state representatives delwin jones rlubbock 86 leo berman rtyler 74 and al edwards dhouston 73 jeff wentworth rsan antonio is the oldest state senator at 69 the youngest members joe moody del paso 29 and ana hernandez dhouston marisa marquez del paso patrick rose ddripping springs and eddie lucio iii dbrownsville who are all 31 at 38 dennis bonnen rangleton is the youngest republican  for now lance gooden who defeated state representative betty brown rathens in the republican primary and doesnt have a democratic opponent in november will be 28 when hes sworn in next january the youngest republican senator glenn hegar rkaty is 39 warren chisum a pampa republican originally elected to the legislature as a democrat is fifth on the age list at 71 and seventh on the house seniority chart hell be fifth next session as edwards and jones both lost their primaries with 21 years in the post he takes the turnover  fast or slow  in stride and says it hasnt really affected him his actions have ive always been the kind of rebel cause guy he says i take positions that arent unpopular with the public but they are in the legislature because a lot of people dont want to vote on social issues and that stuff  senioritys not a big deal to a democrat two years behind chisum on that particular ladder either it takes a certain personality to thrive as a member of the house says pete gallego dalpine some people still look at the list  figure out the seniority and figure out how many square feet of office space they can get  some see it as a cultural difference with younger or newer members coming up in a different kind of politics than their predecessors i look at it in terms of people who have served in two different styles of government gallego says people dont have the opportunity to be larger than life anymore  theyre afraid of seeing it on the internet  its not all the outsized stuff he says in the old way of doing business it was fine to disagree and then go to dinner gallego says now its personal and more partisan and a disagreement on one issue leads to a disagreement on another issue  as the polarization in dc spreads the people willing to come to the middle find less and less acceptance  chisum is one of a couple of republicans  phil king of weatherford is another  whose name comes up in discussions of who might be a challenger to straus next year and people in that spot pay close attention to discontent in the incumbents camp straus won election to the job by joining nearly a dozen republicans with a solid democratic bloc which sticks in the craw of republicans who say theyd prefer a speaker less dependent on support from democrats his support is holding for the time being and its been barely more than a year since he became speaker  not long enough hes hoping for a lot of discontent to build up not a lot of time to get comfortable either jim dunnam plus 15 republicans is a winning ticket chisum says referring to the democratic leader and that coalition that elected straus but he adds the november elections could create serious issues for them  chisums dealing with reality if the numbers dont change in the fall a coup is probably not possible it takes years  or a big election  to get 76 members together to unseat a speaker house speaker pete laney dhale center had a different turnover problem there wasnt enough of it tenured members stayed on keeping their leadership positions for a long enough time to create a group of frustrated younger and less senior members who wanted a turn in management tom craddick rmidland came into the speakers office in 2003 after helping republicans win their first modern majority in the texas house he had two generational advantages a relatively large class of freshmen 35 of them or more than 20 percent of the house packed with republicans he had helped elect and laneys logjam which produced enough democrats to give him the buffer he needed to keep from being a straight partyline choice that group of craddick ds also helped him hang onto the job as the republican majority was whittled down over the years from 16 votes to two new speaker fresh start people whod been out of power came into it people whod been in power fell out and the clocks reset go back to that laney thing though democrats had something of a bottleneck when their elders were slow to move on and once they did craddick was in office he didnt owe his job with some notable exceptions to the democrats so for some the bottleneck remained in place it was hard to move up the difference for speaker laney was that the people who had the chairmanships were content and they wanted to stay gallego says seniority  used in the texas legislature to determine the pecking order on important stuff like office and parking place selection but mostly not on who gets to serve in leadership positions  is a completely different matter it doesnt get you into the position but once youre in youre in your power comes from your knowledge of the subject matter says state representative garnet coleman dhouston ultimately thats the thing with seniority its being around long enough to actually learn something  more than half of the members of the house were elected in 2002 or later they havent been there for 10 years yet one of those for instance is straus on the senate side only 12 new senators have taken office since 2002 and of those five served in the house before moving up their leader lieutenant governor david dewhurst took office in 2003 when most of the current senators were already in the senate senioritys no automatic advantage half of the 10 most senior house members dont chair committees one is craddick who lost his speakership to straus the others are members of craddicks leadership team victors and spoils and all that i doubt he was thinking about it in those terms but straus got to start with a clean slate says state representative mark strama daustin who got a chairmanship from the new speaker as did some other members of his legislative class which was elected in 2004 it created some fluidity that was healthy for the system  straus broke the seniority  the balance of power in the house is in people without a lot of seniority strama says he sees more change coming lawmakers will tackle redistricting in 2011 and the 2012 elections based on new political maps could bring in a relatively large class of freshman another way to say it a relatively large number of veterans could be done after the next session if you were doing this story in two years youd have more to work with he says im big on youth activism  i think the system benefits from what members in their 20s and 30s bring to the discussion strama says chisum in a separate conversation took another tack it bothers me sometimes that we get them too young id like it better if theyd been working for a few years and meeting a payroll  the tribunes matt

Immigration Resolution Now Criticizes "Amnesty"	2013-05-01	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2013/05/01/immigration-resolution-now-criticizes-amnesty/	en	updated 815 pm  the house state affairs committee gave preliminary approval to hcr 44 on thursday evening it passed following an 82 vote earlier state representative jason villalba rdallas said that in addition to adding language that specifically criticizes amnesty the text of the original resolution was also changed to favor a path to earned legal status and not citizenship in order to be considered by the full house the measure must appear on the house calendar by tuesday original story hoping to win conservative support legislators have added stronger opposition to amnesty to a resolution urging congress to reform immigration laws house concurrent resolution 44 by state representatives ana hernandez luna dhouston and rafael anchia ddallas was initially drafted in february but finally got a hearing from the house state affairs committee late wednesday i feel that we are at a point where immigration reform is imminent and texas should be speaking with a strong voice on this issue anchia said texas has as much to gain with comprehensive immigration reform as it has to lose without it initially the nonbinding resolution included key talking points from republican groups that urged reform including the cato institute and the partnership for a new american economy language citing a 2006 study by the state comptroller which showed that deporting millions of texans in the state illegally would have resulted in a loss to the states gross domestic product of 18 billion was also included as were statements of support for immigration reform from former state representatives john garza rsan antonio and raul torres rcorpus christi those are still in the measure but anchia said it was necessary to change some of the language due to what he said was conservative opposition to anything hinting at amnesty nobody in this house supports outright amnesty but rather an earned legal status anchia said the committee substitute that went before the committee included additional language that admonished the most recent reform proposals for not preventing future illegal migration solutions that provide for blanket amnesty such as those presented in the simpsonmazzoli act of 1986 encourage future violations of the law and should be excluded from the panoply of options to be considered by the united states congress the resolution now states the language was included with help from state representative jason villalba rdallas who worked with anchia to draft a resolution more palatable to house republicans bill hammond the president of the texas association of business said supporting the reform effort was timely and would also address one of the key concerns many stakeholders have it is the right thing to do it is proper hammond said we believe the only way we can ever secure our borders is by allowing enough legal immigration to meet the needs of employers  the committee didnt vote on the resolution chairman byron cook rcorsicana expressed his appreciation for anchia and hernandezs efforts but also expressed doubts about congress ability to act most of what can be done needs to be done and should be done were dependent on the folks in congress for that he said i wish this would have a big impact nothing else we have done has motivated them at all  added state representative charlie geren rfort worth id be happy to vote for it if i thought it would do any good when it got to washington  texas tribune donors or members may be quoted or mentioned in our stories or may be the subject of them for a complete list of contributors click here our daily news summary
The Bell Lap	2005-05-30	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2005/05/30/the-bell-lap/	en	the formula here is just as it was at the beginning of the session failure to get results on school finance and property cuts would be horrible news for rick perry less troubling for david dewhurst and tom craddick and of very little political consequence to the average member of the texas legislature those average members only narrowly approved school finance and its companion tax bill in the house and their squeamishness is one reason why the tax bill remained in grave condition as the last weekend of the session approached broadly speaking if the house would go along with the senates package of business taxes or the senate would go along with a onecent increase in sales taxes thats more popular in the house this might end with a deal its a staring contest that neither side wants to lose and that neither side particularly wants to win meanwhile the governor snubbed by lawmakers on his requests to build up the economic development closing fund and for a new 300 million state fund he could direct to emerging technologies continued to complain about the size of the budget telling lawmakers they were spending too much and that they needed to make last minute cuts perrys staff started making noises about state spending a couple of weeks ago  well after the house and senate had done the lions share of work on the budget its a potential political problem lawmakers wrote a 117 billion budget two years ago and are putting the final touches on twoyear budget that totals around 139 billion an increase of 22 billion that does not include any repairs to school finance or any buydowns of local property taxes that applestoapples comparison gets close to a 20 percent jump if it becomes a political issue youll see the apples compared with lemons and oranges more on that when the legislature leaves town if the sessions signature issue passes itll add 11 billion or so to state spending while cutting that same amount from local school budgets someone looking only at the state budget would see a spending jump of nearly 30 percent that squabbling stalled printing of the budget and pushed some of the legislatures heavy lifting toward the close of the session on monday itll be a long four days a key player in the gops 2002 successful effort to take control of the texas house failed to report 613433 in campaign contributions and 684507 in spending and must pay damages to the losing democrats according to a state district judge in austin judge joseph hart didnt say whether the contributions and expenditures themselves were illegal but said the texans for a republican majority political action committee known as trmpac failed to report the money it raised and spent as it should have done he said former representative bill ceverha of dallas the treasurer of trmpac is personally liable for damages totaling 196660 an attorney for ceverha said he wants to appeal the ruling we feel strongly this decision is wrong we will vigorously appeal this ruling immediately if judge hart allows us to do so said terry scarborough ceverhas lawyer we feel confident that judge hart will sever this decision so that it can be appealed our client was exercising his constitutional rights of freedom of speech and freedom of association these are the most fundamental constitutional rights that we as citizens enjoy and cherish  trmpac was the brainchild of us house majority leader tom delay and a key aide jim ellis who wanted to help republicans win a majority in the texas house that majority once elected redrew congressional districts in texas and the gains to republicans in congress in last years election were completely attributable to the texas map each of the seats added to the gops congressional majority is occupied by a texan but questions were raised soon after the 2002 elections about the use of corporate money on the republican side and whether it was used for administrative expenses of trmpac and other groups  thats legal  or for electioneering which isnt travis county district attorney ronnie earle and a string of grand juries have investigated three people including ellis john colyandro and warren robold have been indicted and eight corporations were named along with them several of those companies have signed cooperation agreements with prosecutors in return for having the indictments against them dropped colyandro and ellis are fighting their indictments in criminal court earle wouldnt comment on harts ruling but in a statement said his office is making arguments similar to those in harts ruling in its arguments in the criminal cases judge harts ruling reaffirms the importance of full disclosure to our democratic society he said in the statement ceverhas is the first civil trial stemming from the elections hart found trmpac didnt report 532333 in corporate contributions that were used for campaigning and another 81100 in noncorporate contributions that should also have been reported the pac didnt report 684507 in expenditures that should have been reported five democrats who sued will each get double the amount that was raised and spent against them but not reported hart took that to mean the amounts that were specifically spent on each candidate a conservative reading he reached partly because of a section of state law that gives the state the right to go after trmpac for a much bigger penalty in his ruling hart said the state is entitled to three times the total amount of contributions and expenditures that werent reported or 3893820 attorney general greg abbott would have to seek that amount from trmpac and ceverha a spokeswoman said the agency is looking at the ruling and hasnt decided what it will do a separate civil case alleges another group  the law enforcement alliance of america  didnt report its donors contributions and expenditures for television ads that attacked democrat kirk watson abbotts opponent while boosting abbotts campaign andy taylor the lawyer for the texas association of business which was involved in the efforts to elect a gop majority and which has said it wasnt engaged in direct campaigning for or against any candidates said harts decision doesnt upset tabs case during the 2002 state election cycle tab used corporate funds to create and disseminate 86 public information mailers about candidates to the general public he said in a written statement none of these ads used words of express advocacy  hart said in his ruling that express advocacy is a constitutionally imposed protection for individuals and groups other than political committees such protection is not necessary for organizations like trmpac the major purpose of which is the nomination or election of a candidate tab in taylors argument doesnt fit that definition you can download harts decision wwwtexasweeklycomdocumentshartrulingpdf what started as a minor tax and revenue bill has blossomed into a key piece of the legislatures finance package that could be used to make school finance work or to fill in gaps if property tax legislation falls apart senate budgeteers wanted to use the bill to raise what they call nontax revenue that can be spent on public education but as the session drew to a close hb 3540 was also carrying items needed to balance part of the budget we could plug in numbers but theyd change before you could read to the end of the paragraph instead heres the structure as we understand it add the budget bill  sb 1  and the supplemental budget bill  hb 10  to figure out how much the state wants to spend in the current and the next state budget the supplemental bill initially intended to make appropriations in the current budget that werent needed two years ago when it was written now also includes some appropriations for the 200607 budget together the two bills increase current spending and set the budget for the next two years the income to pay for them comes mostly from existing taxes lawmakers hit the states rainy day fund and also cobbled together a notunusual mix of delayed payments accelerated collections and other tricks to make the budget balance school finance and the tax bill attached to it are meant to balance each other but budgeteers have been working on the assumption that the whole mess will win approval if it doesnt and if there are last minute adjustments to make on either the income side or the expense side theyve got hb 3540 and hb 10 as the vehicles for those tweaks senate finance chairman steve ogden rbryan and house appropriations chairman jim pitts rwaxahachie say the current incarnation of the other tax bill would raise between 35 billion and 37 billion both say they dont think theyll need that much that the final version will be in the 24 billion to 26 billion range top items on the chopping block the tobacco funds transfer changes to the state franchise tax the house doesnt want any taxes to be used for anything except local school property tax relief and transferring funds raised by driver fees but until they decide how much they need they wont set the final makeup of the bill and the list from which they will choose has more junk on it than tom joads pickup truck some items that have been on the list at one time or another in the last week and could still end up in law and how much theyre worth to the budget folk  transfer tobacco settlement fund into general revenue 1034 billion  close the geoffrey and delaware sub loopholes in the states franchise tax to snag companies whose operations are organized in particular ways to avoid the tax 870 million  delay transfers of motor fuels taxes from general revenue to transportation accounts for three months in oddnumbered years 582 million  continue the telecommunication infrastructure fund a temporary tax that was supposed to expire 400 million  temporarily use the texas mobility fund for general revenue 2547 million  kill the early filer discounts given to retailers and car dealers who collect sales taxes 1426 million  move nondedicated funds from motor vehicle registration fees and commercial licenses from the transportation fund to general revenue 136 million  keep the quality assurance fee or bed tax on icfmr facilities but without extending it to nursing homes 108 million  require dealers and others selling cars to swear to the purchase price called liars affidavits 110 million  extend deadlines for corrective actions for releases from petroleum storage tanks for one year 451 million  lower interest rate paid on tax refunds 218 million   set up a multistate medicaid drug purchasing pool 176 million  change deadlines in property value adjustments affecting the states foundation school fund 156 million  extend hotel occupancy taxes to permanent residents 143 million  let indian tribes and certain nonprofits conduct bingo games no estimate  keep new and reinstated state employees out of the state retirement system for their first 90 days at work 66 million  offer incentives to state employees to opt out of state health insurance 33 million  change retirement benefits available to returning retired state employees 19 million a couple of things in the package would cost money rolling forward the existing debt allotment for public school facilities by two years to reimburse districts for debts incurred during the current budget for a cost of 150 million and moving 500 supplements for school employees to the texas education agency from trs keeping new school workers out of the retirement system for their first 90 days and increasing the trscare premium to 65 percent of their pay from the current 50 percent which would cost the 216 million in the first year and 809 million in the second and so gentle reader we come once again to that point in the legislative session where lawmakers scrounging for money go to the comptroller who controls the numbers seeking favor but the tradition of sweettalking comptrollers for more smack stopped pretty soon after carole keeton strayhorn became comptroller instead of flowers and chocolates lawmakers came steaming in with proposed legislation to take the tax courts away from the tax collector they backed off after she told them their efforts wouldnt help their tax bill but might put a dent in her official estimate of the revenue theyre counting on to balance the budget we had the feeling we were getting slowplayed so we moved the hearings over to soah said representative warren chisum rpampa as soon as she woke up over there she started sending these little missiles over here saying shed lower her estimate if hearings were pulled out  in a meeting attended by at least 10 people from the house and the comptrollers office the house contingent  led by representatives chisum jim keffer of eastland and brian mccall of plano  said they had hoped to raise another 1 billion from their tax bill than the comptroller says it would raise at this point accounts vary pardon the double meaning but it works for us the comptroller said taking away the tax courts  an administrative law system that sometimes ends in settlements and sometimes at the regular courthouse  would force her to lower her overall revenue estimate whether or not the tax bill passes the comptrollers numbercrunchers said the house folks would have to make a few changes that have already proven unpopular bringing more businesses into the franchise tax than they proposed and charging a rate higher than they proposed change those things they were told and theyd get another billion out of the tax bill and consequently greater cuts in local school property taxes the housies said they would leave hearings in the agency if she would raise her estimate of the revenue produced by the tax bill wed rather have our money chisum says wed sell out for the money  chisum says strayhorns staff gave a bigger number to senator kim brimer rfort worth last year but that she now says the proposals were different the comptroller put together a sidebyside comparing the old brimer proposal to the current house proposal to show them the location of the hole in their pocket and she said the price she put on brimers bill turned out to be high last year she was looking at a conceptual form but she chopped the numbers down when she saw in legalese what he was really doing to the taxes legislators have been slow this session to employ a timehonored trick let the comptroller write the language after saying what you want thus getting both a solid estimate and the ability to hold the comptroller accountable for the deal by most accounts thats been rarely used this year if youre following that on your home calculator they left the meeting at least 1 billion apart and potentially more that shortfall in the business tax forced the house tax people to regroup trying to patch up their business tax while pushing to see whether the senate would cave in and agree to a onecent rise in the sales tax lieutenant governor david dewhurst said at one point that the onecent hike wouldnt pass the senate which narrowly agreed to a halfcent increase this is strikingly similar to the battle during the last regular session and the special session last spring when spats over state finances led the comptroller to temporarily threaten not to certify that the state budget was balanced in the special session a year ago the legislature responded to that and other battles by stripping strayhorns office of school and state agency performance reviews this time they backed down when she said moving the hearings would prompt her to lower her estimates of state revenue over the next two years and put further pressure on both the state budget being written and on efforts to significantly lower local school property taxes its dangerous in the last days of a legislative session to say anything is surely dead but some things are starting to smell very funny  several agencies that went through sunset this year might be up again in two years the public utility commission the lottery commission the board of medical examiners and the texas alcoholic beverage commission were among the agencies still in the air in the last days  lawmakers averted a standoff on workers compensation insurance reform folding the standalone agency that regulates that industry into the insurance commission setting up a managed care system some businesses wanted and trying to push injured workers back to work sooner unlike most states texas still doesnt require companies to carry insurance for injured workers and as they did with the last reforms in 1989 state leaders said their reforms and market forces would keep the workers and the economy healthy  video lottery terminals or vlts or slot machines had one last chance at a senate vote  their popularity depends on whose vote youre counting and whether you trust that senator  but got sunk when a legislative deadline passed the house is unlikely to go along anyway  a big fix to the states water planning and the money to pay for it also ran out of time senator ken armbrister dvictoria took a run at water regulation including a water tax that would pay for it the tax came under immediate attack and omnibus legislation addressing water rights and regulations stalled in the lower chamber publicly funded vouchers to pay for private schooling locked up the house for five hours before that issue  and the bill to which it was attached  was killed on a technicality the house twice voted to a 7272 tie on a limited voucher program in urban school districts both times on provisions that would have stripped them from sunset legislation for the texas education agency after the bill was up for a final vote but before the votes were taken house speaker tom craddick issued a ruling on seven points of order that had been called earlier in the day by representative jim dunnam dwaco five were overruled but the last two stuck and the bill was dead representative kent grusendorf rarlington who authored the bill and captained the floor fight that started late in the afternoon and went into the evening thanked the house for the debate and was applauded for grace in defeat and that was that a bipartisan band of democrats and renegade republicans led on the floor by carter casteel rnew braunfels charlie geren rfort worth and sylvester turner dhouston turned an evenly split house slightly but decisively against vouchers for house speaker tom craddick rmidland it marked a rare defeat he voted with voucher supporters all night and allowed dunnams point of order to kill the bill only after voucher provisions had been stripped from it that ending followed a long heated debate  for connoisseurs it was a terrific evening of legislative theater  and then a few minutes of tension and surprise geren convinced a narrow majority to remove dallas schools from the pilot voucher program and replace them with the arlington schools in grusendorfs district which hadnt been included in grusendorfs version of the bill that same group of members more or less then helped geren add a change allowing a student to transfer out of an unacceptable school but only to another public school  not by taking a publicly funded voucher to pay for a private school that gutted the voucher provisions grusendorf asked for a vote on the bill representative trey martinezfischer dsan antonio asked for strict enforcement of the vote in laymens terms that kills leniency in the voting preventing members from voting for absent friends for instance it didnt appear that grusendorf had enough voucher supporters on the floor to carry the day and after a minute or so he went to the microphone to ask for a delay in the vote  the better to collect some ayes but the vote had already been called and representative senfronia thompson dhouston angrily yanked the microphone away from him and said she wanted to call a point of order they were at the front mike she then went to the back mike and called a point of order that if sustained would have killed the entire rest of the calendar including the school bill craddick ruled against her but chose that moment to rule on the foul called earlier by dunnam that killed the bill and the house lumbered on into monday night the senate which already approved that sunset bill had extracted promises from the sponsor senator mike jackson rla porte that he would not bring the bill back to them with vouchers in it so the issue was in grave trouble anyhow nothings ever dead while lawmakers are still assembled in austin but the house vote against vouchers and the senates lack of enthusiasm make a resurrection unlikely answer scott brister paul green harriet oneill and dale wainwright question which texas supreme court justices among that ninemember robed gang wont be on the election ballot in 2006 a majority of the justices will face voters next year justice priscilla owens confirmation to the 5th us court of appeals in new orleans opens the ninth spot on the texas court but not another spot on the ballot  her term was up next year anyhow and its a lifetime appointment she might be appointed to a higher court someday but she wont have to run for election to keep her robes after her confirmation vote by the us senate owen issued a statement saying shell remain on the texas court until current business is out of the way shes got to finish writing any opinions she is writing and the court might or might not have other cases to finish in which shes part of a narrow majority governor rick perry will get to appoint her successor who in turn will have to run in next years elections to hold their spot on the states highest civil court whoever that is will be the sixth member of the court to start there as a perry appointee that gives perry an opportunity to put another judge on the panel before the appeal of the school finance lawsuit is decided and maybe if everything happens quickly before its argued in the first week of july the court doesnt have to rule before the march primaries or for that matter the november general election next year but could rule on the constitutionality of the states public school finance system as early as this fall and a new judge doesnt have to be on the court when the arguments are held to be involved in the decision a judge named after the hearing still gets to vote on that decision the trial court ordered the state to fix the system by october the supremes can move that date whether they rule before then or not governor perry sent the special election to replace the late joe moreno dhouston in the texas house for november 8 you can read that to mean he has no intention of calling a special session before then that would require representation for people in that part of houston meanwhile some of the powers that

Losing a Once-in-a-Lifetime Political Donor	2013-04-16	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2013/04/16/losing-once-lifetime-political-donor/	en	bobby jack perry was in some ways the stereotypical mysterious rich texan at the middle of a conspiratorial oliver stone movie he was the sort of political player whose combination of ideology and money influenced legislation and elections far beyond the ability of a normal citizen the selfmade houston homebuilder was one of the biggest bankrollers of conservative causes over the past two decades a financier of politicians like george w bush rick perry and greg abbott of super pacs like american crossroads and make us great again and of 527s that include most famously the swift vets and pows for truth he gave 28 million to texas candidates and causes between 2000 and 2010 and another 38 million over that period outside of texas according to a texas tribune analysis the center for public integrity counted 235 million in contributions to super pacs during the last election cycle among other contributions perry also gave to democrats  not nearly as much but more than 1 million in texas over the last decade most but not all were houston figures like state sens john whitmire rodney ellis and the late mario gallegos and state representatives sylvester turner ana hernandez luna garnet coleman harold dutton and carol alvarado senator eddie lucio jr dbrownsville was a perry favorite and the homebuilder even contributed to san antonio representative trey martinez fischer the thorn in the sides of texas house republicans perry didnt explain his politics his donations his ideology or his aims  not in public and often not to the candidates he financed that left perrys friends and foes to describe him after he died in his sleep this weekend at the age of 80 when you look at texas political history from the 70s to today and particularly the time frame in the late 80s and early 90s we focus a lot on the elected officials said steve munisteri chairman of the republican party of texas at least some of the weight needs to be given to those who financed them  perry fits into a line of rich texans involved in politics a list of names that includes brothers herman and george brown dan root members of the hunt family louis beecherl fred baron bernard rapoport and a few dozen more who gave big to both parties they werent the only sources of political money in their times but they were often the most important ones you can couch it a million different ways but it is a great loss said wayne hamilton a republican political consultant and a former executive director of the state gop it was not just money with bob perry he was one of the moral bulwarks we had concentrating on getting good candidates people think of him as an economic conservative but he was one of the best funders for social conservatives  their acumen and experience were doubtlessly treasured by their political friends but their influence came from their money its critical to have a ready source of funds in politics and its a setback when it disappears dallas trial lawyer fred baron was the primary supporter for texas democrats for a period in the mid2000s helping attract other donors and stepping in with his own checkbook when others fell short thats one reason  not the only one  why legislative democrats increased their numbers in the 2006 and 2008 elections after he died no donor of his caliber came forward to replace him the democrats  not solely for that reason  had disappointing results in texas in many races in 2010 and 2012 the democrats were more dependent on a single donor than the republicans perry was one of a handful of megadonors in texas conservative politics but he was among the most generous and the candidates who depended on him will have to find other patrons to replace him  if they can todd olsen a republican consultant who knew and worked with perry said you dont replace people like perry he gave and he cared about results olsen said in an email he gave without ego  he called perry faithful and optimistic to a fault  steve munisteri met perry as a high school conservative when the houston homebuilder was a regular 1000 donor to young americans for freedom we didnt know him and he wouldnt take our calls most of the time said munisteri now the chairman of the republican party of texas but he supported us  perry was one of four donors who bailed the state gop out of a 900000 debt in the 1980s according to munisteri he was a steady and ready source of funding for a long time which was critically important he said there are only a very few people in the whole country who can give at that level so to have one in texas and to have one who was focused on republicans and have it constant over 40 years is not only a rarity but its certainly possible that it may not be replaceable  thats a problem for munisteris generation and the one behind it a problem they have in common with the democrats it would be a pleasant surprise to find another donor like that in my remaining lifetime  munisteri said it is a matter of some concern that so many of our biggest donors are well

For Immigration Law, a Divided Pathway Emerges	2013-04-16	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2013/04/16/great-divide/	en	two months after a top state democrat filed a resolution telling washington that texas was all in for immigration reform the measure has proved instead to highlight a lingering divide on the issue despite the talk nationwide about broad support for comprehensive immigration reform and embracing those who would come out of the shadows if given the chance texas lawmakers havent bought into the bipartisan hype in february state representative rafael anchia ddallas chairman of the international trade and intergovernmental affairs committee coauthored house concurrent resolution 44 with state representative ana hernandez luna dhouston carefully crafted to include several talking points from republican groups in favor of reforming the countrys immigration system the nonbinding resolution was engineered to be an easy sell it called for an increase in border security stronger monitoring of visas for potential overstays and adopting an employment verification system  all gop talking points but it also supports a pathway to citizenship with fewer than seven weeks left in the legislative session anchia has yet to gain support for the measure from a republican the glitch is in the language said state representative jason villalba rdallas conservatives and others alike are nervous that what path to citizenship means is we have an amnesty program in place he said amnesty means a lot of things to a lot of different people  villalba has taken the lead for the conservatives and is working with anchia to change some of the language we remain optimistic anchia said despite the lack of visible support and were making progress  but this week also proved the state house members need not look to their federal counterparts for advice on finding common ground just days before the socalled gang of eight  a bipartisan coalition of us senators  was scheduled to unveil its plans for immigration reform us senator john cornyn rtexas and us representative michael mccaul raustin filed companion legislation they dubbed the border security results act of 2013  that bill requires the department of homeland security to meet certain benchmarks including a 90 percent apprehension rate and inform congress regularly of its progress in securing the border while anchias measure is nonbinding and symbolic the cornynmccaul measure has teeth and the duo has clout cornyn is the ranking member on the senate judiciary committees immigration refugees and border security subcommittee and mccaul who worked for cornyn in the texas attorney generals office  is the chairman of the house homeland security committee they dont intend to tell dhs how to do its job or derail immigration reform they said adding they want their colleagues to be better informed about the situation on the border as the debate moves forward democrats were not amused with about 800 miles of texasmexico border in the district i know the border impacts every part of our state im hopeful that this bill is a good faith effort to move forward and not an attempt to build another wall between immigrants and the american dream us representative pete gallego dalpine said in a statement his fellow freshman us representative filemon vela dbrownsville added opponents of immigration reform seek to hold the process hostage by insisting on a finding of border security on the usmexico border attaching such a condition to the immigration reform debate is nothing more than a plain attempt to thwart reform efforts in other words those who would condition immigration reform on a finding of border security simply oppose a pathway to citizenship for 11 million unauthorized individuals currently in this country 
                          Texas' voter purge made repeated errors         	2012-11-02	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://www.chron.com//news/politics/article/Texas-voter-purge-made-repeated-errors-4001767.php	en	state election officials repeatedly and mistakenly matched active longtime texas voters to deceased strangers across the country  some of whom perished more than a decade ago  in an errorridden effort to purge dead voters just weeks before the presidential election according to a houston chronicle review of records voters in legislative districts across texas with heavy concentrations of hispanics or africanamericans were more often targeted in that flawed purge effort according the chronicles analysis of more than 68000 voters identified as possibly dead its unclear why so many more matches were generated in some minority legislative districts one factor may be the popularity of certain surnames in hispanic and historically black neighborhoods one mismatch threatened the voter registration of james harris jr a us air force veteran who has voted in every presidential election since the richard m nixon era harris who is africanamerican and shares a name with a dead arkansas man last voted in harris county in july yet inexplicably he weeks later received a letter asking if he had died  apparently because of the 1996 death of another james harris according to the newspapers review harris voted early in the national elections without further incident  though he took along his voter card passport and birth certificate just in case anyone wanted more proof he was alive harris told the chronicle he hasnt been able to shake the feeling that someone has gone to a concerted effort and gone to a lot of time and research coming up with this matrix in a way of being able to knock people off of the voting rolls  his daughter got a dead voter letter too she shares her name and birthday with a louisiana woman who died in 2010 rich parsons a spokesman for the secretary of states office confirmed that officials compared information about all texas voters  including many who had voted since 2010  to longdead people in the social security administrations death database which dates back to 1973 so far 6491 voters identified have been purged he said not limited to race state officials did not use addresses middle names or voting history to weed out false matches nor was race or ethnicity a factor parsons said neither the official list of registered voters nor the social security death master file contain any racial or ethnic data making it impossible for race or ethnicity to play any role or impact in this process he said indeed voters of all races received letters including republican state legislator wayne smith of baytown who is white he apparently was matched with another smith who died 1500 miles away in pennsylvania last year he also was one of more than 4000 smiths who made the state list parsons noted that no geographical information or addresses were used in the dead voter matchups i would also remind you the social security administration does not guarantee the accuracy of its own list he said an austin lawyer who successfully sued to slow the flawed purge was apparently mixed up with a wisconsin resident dead since 2003 according to the chronicle review of social security administration death data in an agreement reached in response to the travis county lawsuit targeted voters were told they will not be purged unless their deaths are confirmed but so far state officials have made no promises to improve the matching process the settlement did not change or impact the process in any way said parsons more dead minorities texas legislators passed a law in 2011 requiring election officials to use social security administration death data to clean voter rolls last summer election officials prepared two lists one contained 8238 socalled strong matches  where voters names social security numbers and dates of birth matched the dead it generated little controversy a much larger list with more than 68000 weak matches  many based on names and birth dates alone  wrought complaints protests from dallas and harris county registrars and the civil suit in travis county the matching effort was overseen by state director of elections keith ingram an attorney who has admitted he knew nothing about election law before taking his current job according to statements hes made under oath he previously oversaw appointments for governor rick perry texas voter data includes no ethnicity information however the chronicle found voters living in legislative districts with high percentages of hispanics or africanamericans were more likely to be listed as dead than others statewide in fact voters in eight heavily minority districts in dallas houston el paso and brownsville were twice as likely to be targeted as voters statewide within dallas houston austin and san antonio voters living in africanamerican or hispanic legislative districts created to improve minority representation also were generally more likely to be listed than those in surrounding counties the newspapers analysis found lawmakers alarmed state lawmakers including elections committee vice chair representative ana hernandez luna a houston democrat already have pledged to review the process to determine why so many voters were wrongly targeted her own district which is heavily hispanic had a high match rate state representative barbara mallory caraway a dallas democrat says she too wants to know why the analysis appeared to have a disproportionate impact on districts like hers which has a high concentration of africanamerican voters im obviously very alarmed and concerned about the possible disenfranchisement of someones opportunity to vote   she told the chronicle im concerned about the accuracy of the list  and id like more of an investigation  one of the four texans who sued the state after being wrongly targeted was austin attorney andrew dylan wood a longtime travis county voter whose father buck wood formerly served as a texas director of elections andrew woods name was linked to a wisconsin man who died in 2003 wood has voted at least eight times since then his hope he said is that after the lawsuit that the secretary of state doesnt do this any more that theyve had their experiment and it did not work and they will figure another way to clear up the rolls

Passage of Sanctuary City Bill a Pyrrhic Victory - The Texas Observer	2011-05-11	TEXAS OBSERVER	http://www.texasobserver.org/passage-of-sanctuary-city-bill-a-pyrrhic-victory/	en	in a statement today governor rick perry applauded the passage of one of his legislative emergency items   hb 12 otherwise known as the sanctuary cities bill the bill roiled the house for three days in a divisive and highly emotional debate before it passed on the final read tuesday afternoon 100 to 47 you cant help but feel that it was a pyrrhic victory for republicans creating bitterness among the legislative body and alienating just about everyone except the republicans who supported hb 12 after 10 hours of heated debate monday night rio grande valley democratic representative veronica gonzales summed it up the face of texas has changed there are more minorities in this state now but you wouldnt know it by looking at this legislation  or maybe you would and that was unfortunately the point as democratic representative harold dutton who is african american pointed out in a floor speech some people believe there are too many mexicans in texas and they believe they are here illegally he said they say there wont be any racial profiling but weve been trying to outlaw racial profiling in this body for a long time look at the front page of the houston chronicle today it says black folks are 23 percent of the houston population yet they are 33 percent of the people who are stopped by the police  the bill wouldnt just affect latino texans he said the bill bothers me because there are nigerians there are italians and people of all nationalities who will be affected in one school in houston there are 80 different countries represented the opposition says this bill will help local officials do their job but its a smokescreen thats not what this is about  throughout the debate republican state representative solomons author of the bill worked to differentiate his bill from the controversial arizona immigration law passed last year he explained that the arizona bill requires police to check for citizenship status his bill prevents cities and state agencies from prohibiting it my bill doesnt mandate anything he said it just creates a uniform policy so that cities cant opt out of federal immigration policies  hb 12 requires that any city school district groundwater district or other state agency follow the law or lose state funding the bill also allows citizens to file a complaint with the attorney generals office against any city police department or other state agency that doesnt follow the sanctuary city law the ag would then decide whether the complaint was worthy of a lawsuit solomons accepted republican amendments to prohibit racial profiling and exclude school districts with the exception of campus police from checking for citizenship tuesday after it was all said and done and the bill was passed houston representative ana hernandez luna gave one of the most poignant personal privilege speeches in the history of the texas house hernandez luna told the chamber that she had grown up undocumented in texas the amnesty granted by president ronald reagan in the 90s had allowed her family to come out of the shadows she said i remember the constant fear i lived with each day she said the daily task to go buy groceries it was a simple task for you but for us it was a death sentence because at any time one of my parents could be deported some say immigrant children are a drain on public schools i dont consider myself a drain i graduated at 16 with honors got a bachelors degree got a law degree and was elected to the texas house at age 27 she said i know firsthand the impact hb 12 will have on families who are undocumented the fear mothers will feel when they go to the grocery store  there was scarcely a pause to consider her words on the house floor before the next bill came up for debate for democrats like hernandez luna the bill was personal and had real implications but for republicans it was just politics and nothing more and they had already moved on to the next task at hand melissa del bosque joined the texas observer staff in 2008 she specializes in reporting on immigration and the usmexico border her work has been published in national and international publications including time magazine and the mexico citybased nexos magazine melissa is a 201415 lannan fellow at the investigative fund

What Must Happen for Texas to Turn Blue - The Texas Observer	2013-05-23	TEXAS OBSERVER	http://www.texasobserver.org/what-must-happen-for-texas-to-turn-blue/	en	you hear the question often is texas becoming a blue state since president obama won reelection in november with an emerging democratic coalition of africanamericans latinos women and young voters political pundits have been talking incessantly about the potential of texas going democratic msnbc has made it an obsession the creation of battleground texasa group formed by former obama campaign staffers to make the lone star state competitivehas only fueled national media speculation that texas is going blue the observer explore this subject at an austin panelwill texas turn blue  thursday night may 23 at 8 pm at scholz garten on the ground however texas remains as republican as it gets the gop boasts comfortable majorities in both chambers of the legislature and controls every statewide office in fact democrats havent won a statewide race in texas since 1994 a 19year losing streak that spans 101 defeats what has democrats hoping they can reverse that trend is the states shifting demographics namely the states latino population is booming latinos tend to vote democratic therefore the theory goes given enough time democrats could start winning statewide office again some say 2014 others 2016 2018 2020 some say it will never happen the flaw in the theory as many democratic strategists and progressive organizers will acknowledge is that you should never assume any group of voters will stick with you indefinitely another problem is that texas latinos go to the polls at a very low rate compared to anglo and africanamerican voters and compared to latino voters in other states if democrats dont increase the voter turnout rate among latinos they might be waiting a long time for the demographics changes to deliver them the state then theres the republican party which isnt going to sit idly by and let the state go democratic the state gop and independent group hispanic republicans of texas have been working for several years to attract more latino candidates and voters to the party so what must happen for democrats to break the gops hold on texas increasing latino turnout is a must especially in the houston area but theres more to it as polling commissioned by the democratic group back to basics pac in harris county during the 2012 election shows democrats have no lock on the latino vote in fact future control of texas may hinge on which latino voters show up at the polls for texas to ever become competitive for them democrats will need to lock down harris county home to 42 million texans almost 70 percent of whom are nonwhite houston is the present and future face of texas former state demographer steve murdock has estimated that by 2040 harris county will have 516000 fewer anglos than in 2000 while the number of latinos will surge by 25 million as houston goes so goes texas given that anglos are already a minority of harris countys population you would think the houston area would be ripe for democratic success yet the county has proved an elusive prize in recent elections harris county has been evenly divided in 2008 barack obama won the county by a little more than 19000 votes in 2012 he did slightly worse beating mitt romney by just 971 votes latinos despite representing 40 percent of the population of the county constitute only 15 percent or so of the electorate partly thats due to how young the latino community is and the presence of many noncitizens but its also due to an abysmal turnout rate thats hampering democratic efforts to turn houstonand by extension texasblue so if youre looking for signs that democrats are making any progress in texas you need to look at houston more specifically you need to see if democrats are harnessing the booming latino population there but hidden in the 2012 election data were trends that should have democrats worried in harris county at least republicans showed surprising strength among some latinos the latino community is hardly monolithic in fact the back to basics postelection survey of harris county identified two hispanic worldsone that votes often and splits its vote between republicans and democrats and another that is overwhelmingly favors democrats but tends not to vote the survey found that latinos who are less likely to voteand who tend to be working class and less educatedoverwhelmingly favored obama in 2012 eighty four percent of these lowpropensity voters said they favored obama versus just 15 percent for romney according to the polling obtained by the observer the obvious conclusion is that getting these voters to the polls can do wonders for democrats said jeff rotkoff who heads the pac but the remainder of the latino community in houston was almost evenly split between obama and romney perhaps more troubling for democrats thinking of running for governor or other statewide office is that the survey of latino voters found significant defections to tea partier ted cruz while obama carried harris county latinos 5940 overall the democratic candidate for us senate paul sadler took only 53 percent to cruzs 46 percent share not only did sadler run behind obama among harris county latinos but among high propensity latinosthose most likely to votecruz bested sadler 5344 percent thats worth repeating among latinos most likely to vote ted cruz won a majority in harris county on the other hand popular harris county sheriff adrian garcia outperformed obama among latinos significantly beating his republican opponent 65 percent to 32 percent the lesson is that latinos are a diverse bunch and that manythe ones who tend to vote at higher ratesare willing to vote for the right republican in short the 2012 election returns in harris county add a wrinkle to the conventional wisdom that increased latino turnout will aid democrats if the polling is correct democrats will takeover harris county and texas only if they can turnout the low propensity voters most likely to support democrats otherwise republicans have shown they can win over enough high propensity latinos to make a democrat winning statewide in texas difficult some texas progressives say theyre already making significant gains in harris county due to efforts organizing and mobilizing in minority communities with traditionally low voterturnout rates in four out of five heavily latino legislative districts targeted by texas organizing project a group trying to mobilize and engage latinos as well as more partisan democratic outfits turnout increased in largely latino districtsby 16 percent in senate district 6 senator sylvia garcia  to 10 percent in house district 143 represented by democratic representative ana hernandez luna texas organizing project top specifically targeted minority communities with the highest concentrations of lowpropensity voters from pasadena to katy to the east end and the north side of houston the groups goal was to talk to voters five times by knocking on doors three times and calling twice texans for americas future a super pac supporting obama also targeted lowpropensity voters in harris county said rotkoff the groups founder the pacs postelection survey points to the coalition the democrats need to build an amalgam of women working class folks and minorities many texas democrats insist that theyve got the message and are serious about civic engagement and turnout the reality is you dont win new voters and get them into the process by ignoring them 18 months every two years says matt glazer executive director of the progressive group progress texas the proof of concept is happening and now people are working in

Dennis the Menace: Bonnen Runs Environmental Committee with ...	2007-05-04	TEXAS OBSERVER	http://www.texasobserver.org/2490-capitol-offense-dennis-the-menace/	en	texas leads the country in air pollution hazardous waste mercury contamination carbon dioxide emissions and any number of other ways you might measure a sick state this session legislators created a bipartisan house environmental legislative caucus to try to fix some of those problems its chair representative ana hernandez is a democrat from houston home to some of the states worst environmental problems hernandez perhaps mindful of the political environment in which she operates has filed several modest bills to start addressing environmental issueswithout overly burdening the local economy one proposal would create a capandtrade carbon dioxide emissions program such programs allow commercial interests to buy and sell pollution rights another would notify homeowners of polluters in their midst yet her legislation faces an insurmountable hurdlethe house committee on environmental regulation sadly the 35yearold chair of the committee angleton republican dennis bonnen is perhaps the legislatures biggest impediment to cleaning up the texas environment bonnen has raised willful ineffectiveness to an art form he is refusing to give hearings to 42 house bills and 8 senate bills in his committee while other committees have met 15 or 20 times environmental regulation has heard bills on just nine days bonnen didnt even call his first meeting until midmarch it has grown so bad that proenvironment legislators write bills in ways that try to avoid bonnens committee betting instead on a brighter future in committees like government reform and regulated industries when bonnen deigns to hold a hearing on a bill he doesnt support he runs the committee like a dress rehearsal for the oreilly factor interrupting witnesses grilling them on minor questions and calling them names when the observer requested an interview to discuss his tenure as chair bonnen declined comment saying yall have written that story just fine im not worried about it  indeed since bonnen has gorged himself on campaign contributions from the industries he supposedly regulates the chairman apparently has little fear that bad publicity from austin will penetrate his overwhelmingly republican district the stain bonnen would leave on texas was far from obvious when he came to the house 11 years ago after unseating democratic incumbent representative david miller just two years removed from st edwards university bonnen took a break from selling life insurance to become the youngest member of the house at age 24 today his web site says he is a vice president with wells fargo  co now in his sixth session bonnen has entrenched himself as angletons representative running unopposed in the last election these days it would likely take more than a wideeyed college grad to unseat him in the last two election cycles bonnen has received more than 85000 from the transportation oil chemical and energy industries including 9500 and 9000 from the political action committees of txu corp and valero energy corp respectively without an opponent to keep him busy in the 2006 election bonnen was free to manage representative glenda dawsons campaign in a neighboring district winning by 20 points after wooing voters with pamphlets that failed to mention dawson had passed away in september bonnen told the brazoria county facts that the flyers were a tribute to dawson and that her daughter had already mailed voters a letter telling them of her mothers death bonnen began to make his mark on the environmental scene in 2003 his first session as chair of environmental regulation in the newly minted republican house in april of that year the national environmental group clean air trust named bonnen one of their clean air villains of the month an award bonnen has said hes quite proud of  bonnen earned a zero percent rating on environment texas 2005 legislative scorecard a pattern developed in bonnens committee bills that strengthen the states environmental regulator the texas commission on environmental quality or tighten industry regulation never get the committee vote that might send them to the full house some never receive a hearing with just weeks left in the 2007 session the window for hearing bills is shutting quickly environmental regulation is becoming a graveyard of stalled legislation the impact at the tceq is stark along with mcgregor republican senator kip averitt chair of the senate natural resources committee bonnen has a dominating influence over how much regulating the state regulator performs the legislature sets the tone for the agency and signals priorities it should follow to the extent that the legislatures timid tceq is timid says representative scott hochberg a houston democrat who has been trying to get bills heard in environmental regulation one bill that could give the tceq some more teeth but has yet to get a hearing is representative dan gattis proposal to toughen penalties against companies that break pollution regulations the georgetown republicans house bill 1917 would require tceq to penalize a company at least as much as it saved by breaking pollution law as unpopular as the legislation is with industry it has bipartisan support in the house still gattis doesnt anticipate his bill will prosper i dont expect this is a bill ill get passed this session but its not something ill quit pushing gattis says its going to take a while to get on through  meanwhile representative scott hochberg doesnt sound so glib about his stalled legislation i never file a bill that i dont intend to pass he says hochberg like bonnen lives in the most polluted corner of the state he says his bill does nothing more radical than give tceq some specific directions without which it cant do much work of substance the houston democrats house bill 2475 would pinpoint the areas with the worst air pollution calling them toxic hot spots and tell tceq to focus on cleaning them up first it has sat in environmental regulation without a hearing since march 12 ten more bills like hochbergs creating tougher standards and greater public awareness about the worst polluters in the state are also sitting without a hearing at one point bonnen informally mentioned that he planned on hearing hochbergs bill in early april the same week as its senate companion which would make it easy for witnesses to travel to austin to testify on both days before the hearing bonnen changed his mind the chairmans contempt for public testimony is now legendary hes a tyrant as a chair says luke metzger of environment texas when metzger testified before the committee about vehicle emissions at an april 10 meeting bonnen repeatedly quizzed him on what else produces carbon dioxide besides cars what followed was an exchange that could have been lifted from an old monty python sketch metzger threw out guesses of different kinds of power plants and was repeatedly told no unless youre talking about plants  metzger finally asked thats right trees that kind of thing bonnen told him its my understanding that was part of the issue in east texas  as is often the custom at the lege bonnen laid into an unlucky succession of austin city employees in an april 3 meeting the following week he grilled environmental defense of texas president and observer board member jim marston for 25 minutes during testimony on a bill to tighten auto emissions regulations after repeatedly interrupting marston to state the facts the chairman derided marstons inability to recognize bonnens version of environmental history the inquisition peaked when bonnen said marston was too ignorant to know the chairmans role in strengthening nitrous oxide limits on school buses the comment drew a rush of murmurs and at least one cry of good lord from the audience in the midst of bonnens more typical sarcastic interruptions like wow and interesting the comment has become a yardstick for how far bonnen has strayed from the civility common among chairs members of other environmental groups say bonnen is the only committee chair theyve seen run meetings this way admittedly the legislatures failure to toughen environmental policies is bigger than bonnen his role as a billkiller for industry is done with the sanction if not the direction of speaker tom craddick yet unlike other chairmen bonnen does not even make the pretense of evenhandedness or even factbased reasoning for that matter in an april committee hearing one witness warned bonnen about emissions statistics supplied by the auto industry dont take the numbers too seriously bonnen was told 13 other states had also been given those numbers and recognized their bias i dont really care what all these other guys believed or didnt believe he said its my job to believe what i want to believe and base

State Rep: I Was an Undocumented Immigrant - The Texas Observer	2011-05-11	TEXAS OBSERVER	http://www.texasobserver.org/passage-of-sanctuary-city-bill-a-pyrrhic-victory-4/	en	in a statement yesterday governor rick perry applauded the passage of one of his legislative emergency itemshb 12 otherwise known as the sanctuary cities bill the bill roiled the house for three days in a divisive and highly emotional debate before it passed on the final read tuesday afternoon 100 to 47 you cant help but feel that it was a pyrrhic victory for republicans creating bitterness among the legislative body and alienating just about everyone except republicans who supported the bill throughout the debate republican state representative solomons author of the bill worked to differentiate his bill from the controversial arizona immigration law passed last year he explained that the arizona bill requires police to check for citizenship status his bill prevents cities and state agencies from prohibiting it my bill doesnt mandate anything he said it just creates a uniform policy so that cities cant opt out of federal immigration policies  hb 12 requires that any city school district groundwater district or other state agency follow the law or lose state funding the bill also allows citizens to file a complaint with the attorney generals office against any city police department or other state agency that doesnt follow the sanctuary city law the ag would then decide whether the complaint was worthy of a lawsuit solomons accepted republican amendments to prohibit racial profiling and exclude school districts with the exception of campus police from checking for citizenship status tuesday after it was all said and done and hb 12 was passed houston representative ana hernandez luna gave one of the most poignant personal privilege speeches in the history of the texas house hernandez luna told the chamber that she had grown up undocumented in texas the amnesty granted by president ronald reagan in the 80s had allowed her family to come out of the shadows she said i remember the constant fear i lived with each day she said the daily task to go buy groceries it was a simple task for you but for us it was a death sentence because at any time one of my parents could be deported some say immigrant children are a drain on public schools i dont consider myself a drain i graduated at 16 with honors got a bachelors degree got a law degree and was elected to the texas house at age 27 she said i know firsthand the impact hb 12 will have on families who are undocumented the fear mothers will feel when they go to the grocery store  there was scarcely a pause to consider her words on the house floor before the next bill came up for debate for immigrants like hernandez luna the bill brought up raw emotion and carried real implications just like it does for at least 135000 undocumented students living in limbo in texas for republicans it was politics this week senate republican brian birdwell tried to pass an amendment preventing undocumented students from receiving instate tuition which was fortunately defeated too bad it wasnt the same fate for republican representative burt solomons hb 12 republicans have a choice they can bring people out of the shadows to become leaders like representative hernandez luna or they can spur generations of uneducated texans who fear a simple trip to the grocery store now hb 12 moves on to the senate  lets hope the legislatures other chamber doesnt choose the latter melissa del bosque joined the texas observer staff in 2008 she specializes in reporting on immigration and the usmexico border her work has been published in national and international publications including time magazine and the mexico citybased nexos magazine melissa is a 201415 lannan fellow at the investigative fund

                          Rep. Hernandez takes a bold stand for Women Veterans with HB 867         	2015-04-16	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://blog.chron.com/insidepolicy/2015/04/rep-hernandez-takes-a-bold-stand-for-women-veterans-with-hb-867/	en	written by candace caruthers 2015 hobby fellow   texas is among the states with the largest number of women veterans 1 figure 1 yet texas is currently the only state with a women veteran population of over 50000 that does not have a longlasting program to address and study the needs of women veterans the 177075 total women veterans that reside in texas deserve better from our state 2 this session state representative ana hernandez has proposed hb 867 that would address this current lack of longterm assistance available for women veterans figure 1 the time has come to demonstrate the texan dedication to women veterans by employing a permanent solution to address their current and future needs women veterans face many unique challenges when attempting to readjust to civilian life these issues will continue to worsen if a solution is not established because the woman veteran population is expected to increase the us department of veterans affairs projects the women veteran population to continue growing from 10 percent to almost 18 percent by 2040 3  figure 2   figure 2 unemployment is a major component of these difficulties according to the bureau of labor statistics returning women veterans from iraq and afghanistan had an 112 percent unemployment rate in november 2014 five percentage points higher than the unemployment rate of returning male veterans from iraq and afghanistan 4 also while the average male veteran is single the average women veteran is both a parent and a spouse unemployment for women veterans has a disproportionate effect on family households reliant on their income onequarter of women service members are also military spouses and are subject to the transient nature of being married to a service member 5 having to move more than two times a year makes job placement and access to local veterans resources particularly difficult representative hernandez recognizes the significance of issues and has introduced hb 867 to address the concerns of women veterans currently the texas veterans program hosts the women veterans initiative this program was started following the 82nd legislature in 2012 as a temporary solution to a long term problem this program helps women veterans smoothly readjust to civilian life although the women veterans initiative is currently temporary hb 867 would permanently implement the program hb 867 establishes the texas women veterans program within the texas veterans commission the programs responsibilities include conducting assessment studies to better understand local factors that affect women veterans as they enter the civilian workforce these assessments are vital for finding the best ways to help women veterans get back to work additionally this program strives to foster longterm relationships with veterans groups county veteran service officers vsos and local business leaders the texas women veterans program also develops policy recommendations for the texas veterans commission to further address challenges affecting women veterans by establishing a permanent texas women veterans program the texas veterans commission will be better equipped to address the longterm systemic issues that face women veterans than existing temporary initiatives are capable of on april 8th 2015 representative hernandez presented hb 867 to the house committee on defense and veterans affairs during the hearing women veterans from throughout the state came to share their stories and testify in support of hb 867 the goal behind hb 867s establishment of a permanent texas women veterans program is to provide texas womens veterans equitable access to federal and state benefits and services also the program would be tailored to the needs of texas women to address genderspecific accesstocare needs the program would be dedicated to improving the quality of life for women veterans and would support events and activities that honor and recognize women veterans in our state hb 867 is an opportunity to demonstrate our lasting appreciation for the texas women who work so hard for their families and their nation candace caruthers is a 2015 hobby fellow majoring in political science she is working in the office of state representative ana hernandez hobby fellows

                          Health care, food programs, human trafficking impact area         	2010-10-14	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://www.chron.com//neighborhood/spring-news/article/Health-care-food-programs-human-trafficking-1717469.php	en	the community impact of health care state funding human trafficking and payday lending businesses were highlighted during a recent panel discussion hosted by northwest assistance ministries for the third year nam hosted a breakfast and legislative forum for area state representatives harris county and houston city officials the forum was divided into two panels the first panel discussing health care and human trafficking were houston mayor annise parker houston city councilman co brad bradford state representatives ellen cohen allen fletcher and debbie riddle harris county sheriff adrian garcia harris county commissioner sylvia garcia and harris county precinct 4 constable ron hickman the second panel addressing hunger and payday lending were state representatives gary elkins armando walle ana hernandez riddle and senfronia thompson moderator for the forum was tom forestier past chairman nam executive board on the topic of health care forestier said budget shortfalls could cut programs such as medicaid and chips and result in increased use of hospital and emergency rooms increasing costs at the state level parker said the key is preventive health care and having a regular health provider the mayor talked about increasing immunizations and prenatal care while working with harris county officials our focus has been on how we can keep people healthier on the front end and focus on wellness activities and making sure the kids are immunized and the communitybased health clinics are strategically located around houston so that people have access in their neighborhoods so they can begin to form that permanent healthcare relationship she said with the legislature returning to session in the spring forestier asked what legislation could be formed to prevent a reduction of services to the medically underserved while reducing the cost to the uninsured i dont believe there is any type of state legislation that we can go in with cohen said we are facing a 16 billion budget shortfall the people of texas are hurting going in and demanding more money from them is not an option  forestier addressed human trafficking its a global issue forestier said the national human trafficking hotline receives more calls for assistance from the city of houston than any other city in the us  cohen added were talking about an issue that affects 800000 people a year around the world its an enormous problem what can we do at the state level weve done a couple of things we passed house bill 4009 that established a trafficking task force it was set up to really look into the issues and see exactly what we can do as far as i can tell funds have been appropriated for it but its going to be a little bit down the road before that takes place the other thing we can do is try to tap any kind of bill that tries to limit and penalize human trafficking i was able to put into place a 5 fee that was leveled against sexually oriented businesses if it cost 10 to go to one it now costs 15 and that 5 goes for programs that involve sexual assault programs that 5 fee raises over 30 million a year  the fm 1960 area in particular has seen an increase in gangs human trafficking and other crimes as well as issues related to sexually oriented businesses since 2004 gangs in all areas of houston have increased 17 percent gangrelated crime has increased 250 percent youve heard from representative cohen how significant our human trafficking problem is as houston continues to be a transportation and distribution point for narcotics weapons and humans garcia said and were seeing just the tip of the iceberg at the sheriffs office we only have five people working for me with the fbi to investigate these sobs four are funded by a grant and one is on your dole  the harris county jail is the largest in the state of texas we house an average of 10500 people there i want to announce to you that in the near future you will be hearing about our relationship with crime stoppers new persons coming into the county jail male or female will walk into an environment where they will communicate to crime stoppers things that are occurring in their community its going to look a little bit like need a lawyer need bond money call crime stoppers  garcia said theyd also be looking into their prostitution cases for information about human trafficking but doing the job with five people is a real challenge the issue of families in a food program and its costeffectiveness in harris county was discussed by walle we spend about 15 million in fingerprinting to prevent fraud with one case being proven he said this year well spend another 17 million doing the process again we can eliminate that  walle said doing so would cut down on the waiting time for families to receive food we can also streamline the program with the asset test walle said there are very few instances of folks who are getting a huge inheritance that would knock them off the food stamp program  elkins responded to the issue of payday lending by saying many people who secure payday loans cant pay them back on payday they begin a cycle of adding to their debt each payday which is exactly what the lenders want he reiterated that congress cannot regulate or control the law of supply and demand and the law of unattended consequences he went on to explain how payday lending has affected bankruptcies bank fees and other bank charges he said in states that have outlawed payday

                          Letters: The life without papers         	2010-05-09	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://www.chron.com//opinion/outlook/article/Letters-The-life-without-papers-1694064.php	en	 state representative ana hernandez jumped on the bandwagon with those intent upon using fear of what might happen to convince citizens that the new arizona immigration law is a bad idea arizona law is dangerous approach to border issues page b7 may 1 as with many who take that stand she seems to quickly cruise over the core issue and try to anticipate what will happen if the new law is abused the core issue is that there are millions in this country breaking the current law and they are continually being allowed to do it allowing people to wantonly and freely break the law is a slap in the face of those who take pains to abide by it not only as relates to immigration but every other law on the books hernandez uses an example to support her position in which she says my family lived in constant fear while living undocumented in the united states until immigration reform was passed in 1986 providing us with the opportunity to become legal residents and ultimately us citizens  i have nothing against hernandezs family but people who are not abiding by the law should live with some degree of fear our country is based upon a combination of many freedoms but also the rule of law and the expectation that citizens and visitors taking advantage of those freedoms also adhere to the laws that support them if you dont you should be held accountable that is at the core of what the arizona law gets at and is what the federal government should be looking to do as soon as possible f marchhart porter  in regard to texas needs laws to stem tide of illegal immigration page b7 may 1 state senator dan patrick can play a constructive role in the state legislature but his oped on the arizona legislation that has been widely criticized by the business community almost all police chiefs human rights groups and others misses several significant points   everyone is against illegal immigration but this is a federal issue and he should be taking the high ground in advocating that congress immediately enact immigration reform that will not only strengthen border security but will also contribute to enforcement by providing for a workable verification system ninetynine percent of those who come to the us illegally or overstay do so in order to work and to create avenues so that others can come in legally it is a myth that if people go home they can come in legally   in talking about the cost to texas in terms of dollars he completely ignores the fact that undocumented immigrants pay taxes just like all of us irrespective of their immigration status the last report on the subject from thenstate comptroller carole keeton strayhorn showed that in reality illegal immigrants actually paid into texas taxes more than texas pays out   furthermore patrick talks about how much texas is already spending in holding convicted criminals and yet proposes to criminalize what the federal government treats as a civil matter this would divert the attention of the police from pursuing real criminals and greatly increase the cost of incarceration not only that but every alien detained on a criminal matter is entitled to a jury trial and if they cannot afford it a courtappointed attorney all of which would prevent our overworked police officers and the judicial system from pursuing serious criminals because they are instead focusing on nannies agricultural workers construction workers etc many of whom have been here for decades these are serious issues that deserve serious discussions as to how they can be addressed which will reflect our values recognize the humanity of the individuals who are here and do so in a way that does not destroy our economy charles c foster houston  the article by state representative ana hernandez resulted in pouring more gasoline on the fire that is the current debate on immigration rather than trying to defuse the situation she states that this vaguely written bill promotes racial profiling and forces peace officers to act as immigration officers  she also argues that this should be looked at as an economic issue illegal immigrants contribute to the economic vitality of the state in which they live implied also is the argument that because there are so many illegal immigrants residing in the united states currently they should be given special treatment even though they broke the law by crossing the border without the proper documentation i believe that we are losing sight of the main reason to control the flow of people crossing us borders especially the southern one the most important reason to be vigilant is to weed out the criminals and the drug smugglers and human traffickers if someone who is here legally or is a citizen is stopped and asked to show valid documentation that is a minor inconvenience in the effort to control our borders and to maintain a safe environment for the citizens of this country philip tereskiewicz houston  thank you oscar casares for explaining cinco de mayo holiday of cinco de mayo is minor event in mexico page b9 wednesday i dont celebrate it or any other mexican holiday but its good to know why the bar owners get so excited on this date the oped asks why we celebrate cinco de mayo instead of diecisis de septiembre which casares explains is a much more celebrated holiday in mexico my question to him is this why should we celebrate any mexican holidays in the us this is not mexico do mexicans in mexico celebrate july fourth tony black houston  a new report claims that monthly rent payments remain out of reach for many lowincome texans many struggle with rising rents across the us page d3 april 25 as legislators and advocates look for ways to provide relief to those struggling to stay afloat it is important to consider which policies work best unfortunately the povertyreduction strategy that is most popular  raising state and federal minimum wages  has also proven to be one of the least effective new research from economists at the university of alabama and east carolina university finds that 85 percent of poor families received no benefit from the 40 percent increase in the federal minimum wage that took place between july 2007 and july 2009 this means that parttime workers from middleclass families are getting a bigger paycheck while the poorest continue to suffer by contrast an expansion of the earned income tax credit would have lifted 195 million americans out of poverty  25 times more than the federal wage hike michael saltsman research fellow employment policies institute washington dc

                          Voter registration system worked for all in 2008         	2009-11-06	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://www.chron.com//opinion/outlook/article/Voter-registration-system-worked-for-all-in-2008-1750627.php	en	the houston chronicles editorial entitled fitting solution oct 29 page b8 began with the statement the rejection of more than 60000 voter applications last year for technical reasons by the harris county tax assessorcollectors office prompted a lawsuit by the texas democratic party  i want to thank the editors of the houston chronicle for correcting this figure the actual number as verified was only 3518 in addition the editors noted that the figure being used by harris county democratic party chair gerry birnberg 70000 rejections in a previous news story was incorrect as that figure was 20 times higher than in reality the lawsuit was filed without their use the public should not be misinformed tens of thousands of potential voters were not denied their voter registrations in the previous election cycle the fact is 3518 voter registration applications were specifically rejected by law as being ineligible according to and as accurately described in an oct 28 press release issued by leo vasquez the harris county tax assessorcollector he went on to describe an additional 64036 applicants who had been sent letters of incomplete as mandated by the texas election code for errors such as unsigned applications failing to provide a valid voter identification number failing to affirm their us citizenship etc the law requires these errors be corrected by the applicant furthermore the tax office confirmed that 29386 applicants of these 64036 became registered voters while another 22518 were themselves already duplicates in the voter registration system thus the bulk of these voters 81 percent became a new part of the voter roll or had their registration updated in 2008 they joined nearly a quarter of a million other registration cards sent out during the same 2007to2008 electionyear cycle by the tax office which resulted in a record voter roll of nearly 1964 million citizens by the presidential election day only 12132 applicants less than 1 percent of the total voter roll failed to respond to any voter registration department notice and were not added to the voter roll as their registration applications remained incomplete the editorial continued with the statement that the plaintiffs contended that these rejections vastly exceed other texas counties and that a quarter of those applying were disallowed without timely notification however as accurately reported to harris county commissioners court in a letter dated june 23 2008 by vasquez harris county rejections totaled only 3518 dallas county had 1183 bexar county had 7001 and tarrant county 10471 thus harris countys totals are not out of line with other counties facts are stubborn things the fact is that the harris county voter registration department succeeded in processing more than 97800 voter registration applications received on the oct 6 cutoff date and had all of them processed in less than a month so that each potential voters status was determined by election day by doing our work correctly the tax office could quickly answer a record 55000 phone calls on election day from voters and election judges the verbal instructions provided by the texas secretary of states election division leadership to my office and other area voter registrars about the state mandated seven day processing period instructed us to do our best with our backlogs as quickly as our resources allowed because they were aware that it would be impossible to resolve all the necessary changes to the voter roll within the sevenday administrative deadline given the volume of registrations submitted in a presidential election year state officials also reminded us that there was no penalty in the election code for missing this deadline the harris county tax office got the job done getting these voters on the rolls even though the office received many more transfers of voter applications from the secretary of states office well after the cutoff date only one election contest was filed after the election pierre vs halbach which was a harris county state judicial election decided by only 230 votes a visiting judge threw out the case on summary judgment citing a complete lack of evidence you cannot have that result and the voter rolls so terribly wrong at the same time things just dont work that way in the real world what i cannot let stand is a vilification of the voterregistration system that worked successfully in the nations thirdlargest county in 2008 pierre the same plaintiff who lost his election challenge in 2009 was one of the parties to the settlement signed by vasquez the willingness of the current republican harris county tax assessorcollector and the new democratic county attorney to settle a lawsuit with both the state and local democratic parties through mediation does not alter the facts of the case nor does it alter the successful efforts of all the staff that got 97800 registration applications on the voter roll in time for the election as stated by the harris county attorneys office the resolution agreement recently signed is a go forward document that does not reference any voterregistration department actions in 2008 the texas election code procedures and voterregistration cards were also changed in 2009 by the texas legislature this lawsuit settlement didnt make these changes after the fact and these changes were actually worked on by two staff members of the harris county tax office they are the same two staffers that democratic state representatives garnet coleman and ana hernandez asked republican vasquez to fire on april 13 2009 because they had testified on neither for nor against a proposed photo id bill at the request of the house and senate leadership it was only after this public policy battle in austin that the business association of a staff member was added to the cases discovery proceedings politics are always at work while the inevitable political discourse diatribes and debate continue on this issue i ask the voters of this county to remember clearly that the voterregistration system worked well in harris county for nearly 2 million registered voters in 2008 again it worked just fine on this tuesdays local and state elections without any lawsuit settlement required bettencourt announced he was stepping down as harris county taxassessor collector in december 2008 to go into private business

                          US House expands children's health insurance funding         	2009-01-14	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://www.chron.com//news/nation-world/article/U-S-House-expands-children-s-health-insurance-1739343.php	en	the us house widened spending on childrens health insurance wednesday handing presidentelect barack obama a quick opportunity to sign a law crucial to the estimated 1 million hispanic voters in texas who supported him the bill which would add 4 million children to the 7 million already receiving government subsidized health insurance passed easily 289139 supporters expect it to breeze through the senate the 323 billion cost of expanding the state childrens health insurance program for the next 412 years will be passed on to smokers in a 61cent increase on the federal tax on a package of cigarettes portions of the bill expected to be signed by obama soon after taking office give states the option of eliminating a fiveyear wait for coverage of children of legal immigrants and pregnant immigrants advocates for houstons large immigrant community said the bill has been much needed for years this is welcome news for our community because we have been ignored by the last administration on these issues said nelson reyes executive director of the central american refugee center in houston it gives a message of hope  texas already provides childrens health insurance for legal immigrants which it started in 2007 but this would give the state federal dollars to help pay for the program outgoing president george w bush vetoed similar legislation twice in 2007 and texas conservatives who opposed the bill wednesday are outraged not only by the potential costs but the extension of health benefits to immigrants obama praised it however saying in this moment of crisis ensuring that every child in america has access to affordable health care is not just good economic policy but a moral obligation we hold as parents and citizens  that is why im so pleased that democrats and republicans  came together to provide health insurance to over 10 million children whose families have been hurt most by this downturn  currently about 16200 legal permanent resident children are enrolled in texas childrens health insurance program at a cost of 252 million this year said texas health and human services commission spokeswoman stephanie goodman the agency estimates there will be 20000 such children in the program next year at a cost to state taxpayers of 333 million its great and im pleased to see congress recognizes the budgets of texas and other states are severely strained and hopefully this funding by the federal government will allow texas to maintain current levels of service to children on chip without increasing taxes said state representative ana hernandez dhouston the main change for immigrant children in texas is that the federal government would pick up 72 percent of the cost of providing them with the subsidized health insurance there currently are 454596 children enrolled in chip and some texas legislators already are talking about expanding eligibility guidelines and covering about 160 000 more children at a cost of roughly 100 million a year senate finance committee chairman steve ogden rbryan said the state would consider expanding the program if the federal government included financial incentives but said the question is whether there would be enough money in a tight state budget for texas to cover its share senator eliot shapleigh del paso said democrats will have to make the argument that spending priorities should focus on children in a state budget that will be hard hit by hurricane ike recovery spending when were competing ike against kids thats the issue shapleigh said outgoing texas house appropriations chairman warren chisum rpampa said conservatives would balk at expanding chip because many working parents with employer provided health insurance would be tempted to go onto the governmentsubsidized program because it is cheaper is this hillary health care disguised as chip chisum said referring to senator hillary rodham clintons attempts to create universal health care when her husband was president us representative john culberson rhouston called wednesdays vote outrageous because it was written in secrecy with no public hearings and no public input and no amendments it was dropped directly onto the house floor with less than 24 hours notice  culberson who voted no along with houston gop congressmen ted poe and michael mccaul questioned how states would verify citizenship of applicants and set their eligibility standards the first question we must ask on every piece of legislation is is it fiscally responsible and affordable at a time of trillion dollar deficits culberson said during debate on the vote house speaker nancy pelosi issued a statement saying the bipartisan chip bill is only the beginning of the change we will achieve with our new president stewartpowellchroncom rgratcliffechroncom

at hisd headquarters waiting for the houston hispanic chamber of commerce to start their news conference in support of superintendent abelardo saavedra and im experimenting with live blogging ill do my best to keep you updated on the chambers event and on the school board meeting that follows 306 pm laura murillo head of the hispanic chamber seems confident the board wants to oust saavedra the timing of the board could not be worse dr saavedra is leading the school districts recovery for hurricane ike  state senator mario gallegos is up now gallegos has strong words for the board i would strongly urge the hisd trustees to share his focus and concentrate on our children and i would urge the board to exercise caution when evaluating the next move with dr saavedra this appears to be more of a political move than a true job evaluation  responding to questions from reporters murillo said she has not spoken with saavedra and no surprise i dont see him hiding in the bushes outside central office where the group is gathered no board members are here either around 320 pm board member manuel rodriguez jr showed up and walked into a crowd of tv cameras he repeated his support for saavedra and said reporters should ask board president harvin moore who is spearheading the antisaavedra movement politicians who showed up in addition to gallegos state representative ana hernandez houston city councilman james rodriguez and former city councilwoman carol alvarado gallegos said hisd board member diana davila was supposed to show up but i havent spotted her if thats true that would be two votes for saavedra  rodriguez and davila 332 pm board president harvin moore has responded to my email from earlier he said i still dont expect action but as i said friday it is possible the meeting posting for tuesday is the same but my expectation is the same  to explain the board also will meet tomorrow the main focus of both meetings is training for trustees but as i mentioned earlier the generally worded posting allows the board to take action on saavedras contract 354 pmsome members of the chamber and reporters are now comfortably sitting in the airconditioned board room awaiting the board meeting to begin at 4 pm im told the board is going to allow some speakers at the beginning of the meeting which is odd for a special called meeting but i wont join the conspiracy theorists yet other faces in the audience chuck robinson executive director of the congress of houston teachers and corina ortiz of the houston federation of teachers hft president gayle fallon is in dallas today but when i spoke with fallon by phone earlier it was possibly a first  she didnt have an opinion on whether saavedra should stay or go our view is thats a nowin political situation for a labor union  robinson also stayed neutral though he surmised that saavedras biggest problem is his lack of political savvy the bond debacle the performance pay controversy  others anyone 409 pm saavedra just walked out to applause from the audience and hugged murillo two board members  rodriguez and larry marshall  are seated saavedras attorney vidal martinez is here and in good spirits and so is the boards attorney david thompson they were talking longhorn football when i asked if this would be much ado about nothing thompson said he hoped so 416 pm sixteen minutes late but president moore just arrived so the ball should start rolling soon 421 pm moore calls the meeting to order all but paula harris are here moore says he will allow the board to divert from its normal practice and allow audience members to address the board before going into closed session rodriguez makes the motion to suspend the rules and larry marshall gives the second murillo reiterates her comments from the news conference 431 pm the third speaker is up patting saavedra on the back the pluses we keep hearing more exemplary schools a focus on a collegebound culture the passage of the bond healthy finances 436

                          Why Latinos in Texas will support Obama         	2008-03-02	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://www.chron.com//opinion/outlook/article/Why-Latinos-in-Texas-will-support-Obama-1545545.php	en	the march 4 primaries in texas and ohio loom large for barack obama and hillary clinton due to obamas large lead in delegates and the popular vote commentators believe and even former president bill clinton concedes that hillary cinton must win texas and ohio by large margins to remain a viable candidate with texas population being 36 percent hispanic with nearly 84 million hispanics and 36 million eligible hispanic voters comprising almost 25 percent of all eligible voters in texas according to the pew hispanic center the latino vote for once will play a major role in the outcome of the texas primary the clinton campaign believes or hopes that the latino vote in texas will come through for their candidate as it did in california and other states many latino elected officials and party bosses around the state lined up early behind clinton and boasted of clintons inevitability not so fast recent trends show that obama is poised to cut into clintons margin of the latino vote and thus break her firewall in texas why was there a perception that clinton had a lock on the latino vote for one the clinton name is wellknown in the latino community the clintons have had a long history with latino voters in texas starting in the 1972 presidential election when they helped organize getoutthevote efforts for george mcgovern older latinos fondly remember those days and recall that president clinton awarded the presidential medal of freedom to farm worker advocate cesar chavez posthumously but younger welleducated and other latinos with little or no connection to the 1972 elections or to party bosses and the political establishment are taking a fresh look at the candidates an example  my parents roland and annie garcia in corpus christi are diehard clinton supporters on the other hand my brother gilbert garcia is an active obama team leader and my daughter kristin garcia is a firsttime voter and an obama precinct captain there is another dynamic at play as voters have more time to get to know obama his positions his record and his persona the more they are drawn to his candidacy between the south carolina primary on jan 26 and the super tuesday primaries on feb 5 there was precious little time for obama to travel to 22 states to reach out to latino voters but since his string of 11 straight state victories began obama has had more time to travel through texas and speak with the voters texas voters are learning that obama also has worked tirelessly for the hispanic community for more than 20 years  beginning as a community organizer fighting for neighborhoods on chicagos south side they can appreciate his sacrifices coming out of harvard law school when he passed up opportunities to work in prestigious judicial clerkships and major law firms instead practicing civil rights law on behalf of the poor latinos also can relate to his work as an illinois state senator where he championed legislation to expand healthcare coverage to uninsured children and parents they also applaud obamas belief that all students regardless of national origin deserve an equal opportunity to a high quality public education his support for comprehensive immigration reform and legislation to keep immigrant families together especially resonates with latinos latino democrats like all democrats want a winner for the general election they know our slowing economy the growing deficits and our diminished standing around the world cry out for change from the status quo like most everybody else latinos are tired of the washington gridlock and the partisan bickering the theme of experience from the clinton camp rings hollow as many voters do not equate longevity in washington with the type of change we need now they want something different so who is best positioned to win the general election if you go by public opinion the new york timescbs poll found that nearly 60 percent of democrats believe obama has the best chance of beating john mccain compared to 30 percent for clinton in the primary every major newspaper in texas endorsed obama and recently former governor mark white endorsed the illinois senator respected latino leaders like former energy secretary federico pena former houston mayor pro tem gracie saenz and state representatives jessica farrar ana hernandez and dora olivo are campaigning across texas for obama political guru george strong recently stated i think senator obama can win the election and i think it is time to give the next generation of americans their turn at leading our country even superdelegates who pledged support to clinton have recently switched to obama none is defecting from obama to clinton obama is drawing recordbreaking crowds across texas the euphoria for obama is bringing massive numbers of new voters and independents into the electoral process all across texas something we have not seen for a long time the trends are ominous for clinton consider that in november clinton enjoyed a 51 percent to 17 percent polling advantage over obama in texas according to the instant runoff voting poll just last week the public policy poll showed them dead even at 48 percent each in fact obama actually won the latino vote in iowa virginia illinois and connecticut the more time voters have to get to know obama his track record and his vision for bringing people together to solve problems the more they gravitate to his candidacy latinos are no exception garcia is a houston attorney and past president of the hispanic bar association of houston he is supporting barack obama has contributed money to obama for america and serves on the obama campaigns finance committee texas leadership team and latino leadership council he can be emailed at garciargtlawcom
                          Straus faces tea party-backed challenge for Texas House speakership         	2012-11-10	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://www.chron.com//news/politics/article/Straus-faces-tea-party-backed-challenge-for-Texas-4026633.php	en	austin  house speaker joe straus bid for a third term as leader of the 150member state house may not come as quickly or as easily as he had anticipated the san antonio republican finds himself caught between the proverbial rock and a hard place his reelection path is complicated by a challenge from the hard conservative wing of his own gop combined with growing unease among some democratic legislators upset with how straus handled last years redistricting and other issues affecting minorities straus faces a challenge from representative bryan hughes rmineola who is drawing support from tea party republicans freedomworks and some of the chambers more conservative members straus confident of prevailing is content to let the process play out i have a broadbased bipartisan coalition of supporters in the house that spans the ideological spectrum he said the members know that i have presided over the house in a way that is fair  76 votes needed unlike the governor and lieutenant governor who are elected by texas voters the speaker of the texas house of representatives is chosen by members during the first day of each legislative session it takes at least 76 votes to win the highly prized speakership the speaker appoints legislative committees and their leaders and also controls the flow of legislation straus is counting on support from a solid chunk of the chambers 95 gop members along with most democrats who have supported him in the past particularly in 2009 when he upset incumbent speaker tom craddick rmidland however during a democratic caucus meeting on thursday members decided to temporarily withhold support for anyone were not in any hurry said democratic caucus chair jessica farrar dhouston i am not excited farrar said democrats generally could not back hughes because his support from the most conservative texans conflicts with the states need to invest in education health care water transportation and other infrastructure i dont really have much of a choice quite frankly i am not excited about joe straus she said straus standing among many minority lawmakers diminished during the 2011 legislative session following good reviews of his leadership two years earlier many remain upset with straus handling of redistricting voter id immigration and cuts to public education funding including a 300 million cut to kill the states fullday prek program joe straus seemed to be very uncaring when he cut public education by 54 billion for a statewide system thats 51 percent hispanic representative trey martinez fischer said he had no problem trying to curtail and take away minority voting rights voter id and he participated in a scheme to intentionally discriminate against minority voters when it came to redistricting  hispanic strength federal appellate courts have invalidated both the voter id bill and the redistricting map as violations of the voting rights act martinez fischer said straus needs to decide if he will be pragmatic or cater to his partys extreme fringe which does not reflect the states future hispanics are expected to surpass whites as the states largest population group by 2020 texas hispanics and africanamericans combined already outnumber whites but those numbers are not reflected in the state legislature where 67 percent of its 181 members are white when joe straus makes it clear to me what direction he wants to go in then i will evaluate whether or not thats a direction that i can support martinez fischer dsan antonio said hughes is a sixterm legislator from east texas making the same pitch to his colleagues from both parties he believes the house needs to be more open transparent and inclusive straus advocated the same when he challenged craddick members are questioning whether his record matches up with the rhetoric hughes said hughes endorsements both liberal and conservative legislators are upset with disclosures during the redistricting trial showing that outside forces had considerably more influence on redrawing new house maps than they did gop lawyer michael hull did much of the work behind the scenes on a map that targeted several hardcore conservative republicans texans for lawsuit reform also played a heavy hand behind the scenes in an email to straus allies and senior staff members tlr cofounder dick trabulsi discussed his preference for the house redistricting map and proposed a coordinated statement from his organization and two gop groups declaring support for a specific map if tlr is going to help proactively i need to know whats going on and what you want us to do trabulsi wrote in an email discovery during the redistricting trial process at least 100 texas grassroots conservative leaders including more than 20 county gop chairs and 10 state republican executive committee members endorsed hughes last week mainstream issues former texas gop chair and texas eagle forum president cathie adams said straus challenge is more serious this year than the effort representative ken paxton rmckinney made before the 2011 session because hughes started earlier the issues that matter to voters are mainstream issues that straus was unable to accomplish adams said citing balancing the budget without gimmicks and tsa transportation security administration groping were two of them sanctuary cities were another  but representative lyle larson contends his fellow conservatives are misguided in taking on straus and are hurting the cause by competing against one another in a fight to be perceived as most conservative  veteran legislator representative garnet coleman dhouston will support straus and agrees with objections from fellow democrats about straus handling of issues important to democratic constituencies thats because hes a dyedinthewool republican coleman said hes not going to be anything but i never had any expectations otherwise  representative ana hernandez luna dhouston is taking a waitandsee attitude like many of her democratic colleagues she is still unhappy with straus leadership last session we need commitments from speaker candidates that they will respect the legislative process and that we will be allowed to represent our districts she said straus i look forward hernandez luna is still upset that gop leaders stopped debate on an immigrationrelated bill last session before democrats could present all their amendments she responded with an emotional personal privilege speech describing her fear as a child that one of her undocumented immigrant parents would not return from a shopping trip because of detection and deportation the speaker said most legislators agree with him that texas needs to focus on such priorities as education water energy transportation and budget transparency and not get sidetracked with divisive speaker politics the state is growing and evolving and always changing straus said i dont look back i look forward demographics change and the house changes but the way i have done business in the house  trying to draw people together and doing the serious work of the state  is going to continue to succeed  gscharrerexpressnewsnet
                          Hispanics hold key votes as Dems race for the win         	2008-02-23	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://www.chron.com//news/houston-texas/article/Hispanics-hold-key-votes-as-Dems-race-for-the-win-1762327.php	en	the eyes of texas and the nation are focused on the redhot democratic primary race between hillary rodham clinton and barack obama the presidential candidates themselves however have their sights set on a key audience theyre wooing in advance of the march 4 texas primary hispanics and no county in texas has more latinos than harris where an estimated 15 percent of the 18 million registered voters are hispanic after losing 11 straight primaries clinton must win delegaterich texas central to her strategy will be maintaining an edge among hispanics who have supported her by 2to1 margins in earlier primaries with 26 delegates at stake in the greater houston area and obama attracting votes from many demographic groups in recent primaries clinton will need strong support here from hispanics to save her campaign its uncertain though how many latinos will vote their turnout has been historically low but many experts say excitement about the primary among hispanics locally is unprecedented one thing about the latino vote and ive been dealing with it for 36 years when theyre told theyre fixing to be center stage  theyre going to come out to vote predicts marc campos a longtime houston political consultant i hate to say it but hispanics feel disenfranchised said porras who has not decided which candidate hell support they think its not worth their time that all politicians are crooks or they got an angle  that kind of stuff  and the poor porras said are more worried about their light bills than delegate counts in california where latino voters made up 30 percent of the voters 69 percent voted for clinton and 29 percent for obama this is the state both campaigns need  him to keep moving and her to stay in the game said lydia camarillo vice president of the southwest voters registration and education project in san antonio which registers hispanic voters camarillo predicts hispanic turnout in texas next month could rival the california primary citing resources the obama and clinton campaigns are marshaling in texas its going to be high camarillo said if we have 60 percent turnout out of total voters as in california i would say the share of the latino electorate would be 30 to 35 percent  harris county has 273000 voters with spanish last names on the current roll of 1826000 registered voters said hector de leon director of voter outreach for the harris county clerk clinton has garnered support of a number of hispanic elected officials in houston including state senator mario gallegos and county commissioner sylvia garcia texas is the state that can push her over the line said former city council member carol alvarado a clinton campaign cochair in texas you have a lot of things going here  you have a large latino vote and a long history of a relationship between both bill and hillary and texas  hillary clinton often highlights her texas connections by citing stories of helping register voters in the rio grande valley in 1972 gallegos believes clinton will receive the majority of the hispanic vote in a democratic primary that has energized latino voters for the first time theyre seeing where their vote means something especially in a presidential election he said and thats why theyre coming out  in the 2006 general election only 256 percent of the districts registered voters participated compared with a 405 percent turnout across the state according to an election analysis by the texas legislative council but both candidates are airing spanishlanguage ads and campaigning in south texas gallegos said clintons championing of universal health care helps fuel her popularity among hispanics the economy education the war jobs  those issues mean nothing to a texan or an american if they are not alive said gallegos who was gravely ill until receiving a liver transplant last year thats why health care especially in the hispanic community where the rate of diabetes is high is a very important issue  obama campaign spokesman nick shapiro acknowledged the clintons deep connections with hispanics in texas however given senator obamas long track record of fighting for the hispanic community bringing democrats and republicans together to expand access to health care cut taxes for working families and pass groundbreaking ethics reform we expect support in the hispanic community in texas to grow steadily shapiro said a growing list of hispanic elected officials supporting the illinois senator includes state representative ana hernandez an attorney whose district is 76 percent hispanic and includes parts of east houston the port of houston and pasadena hernandez said obama will be able to attract latino support its a mistake when people think that latinos will automatically support hillary hernandez said dora olivo a state representative whose district includes missouri city said she is backing obama because of his immigrant background his father is from kenya he has lived in two worlds said olivo a secondgeneration mexicanamerican the fact

                          University of Houston gives its support to Texas DREAM Act         	2015-02-11	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://blog.chron.com/lavoz/2015/02/the-university-of-houston-supports-the-texas-dream-act/	en	  the university of houston followed in the footsteps of other major universities on wednesday and officially offered its support to the texas dream act which allows undocumented students to pay instate tuition just when several bills introduced in the republicancontrolled legislature try to repeal it we oppose any effort to repeal the texas dream act and reaffirm support for the established law allowing instate tuition for undocumented immigrants who are seeking legal residency said the university of houston in a statement sent to la voz the declaration of uh comes at a time when republicans are trying to modify and even repeal the law which passed in texas in 2001 at least they have already submitted two bills in the current legislative session in texas besides lieutenant governor dan patrick said during his campaign that he favored a change in the law we believe all texas high school graduates should enjoy equal access to our state universities and the opportunity to obtain a college education becoming better informed and more productive contributors to our community says the statement according to data provided by the university the percentage of students enrolled on the basis of the law is low enrollment records for the fall semester 2014 at uh main campus indicate that of 49914 students enrolled only 656 took advantage of the law in question and just 538 are hispanic in uhdowntown the data for the same period indicate that only 380 of 14438 students has taken advantage of the law and among them just 330 are hispanic however there is no reason for uh to take this step we were asked by several legislators to provide a statement of policy regarding the texas dream act we always like to respond to our legislators and weve done so in this case said jason smith vice president for governmental and community relations at uh we were asked by representative ana hernandez in particular but others were interested as well  although he did not mention other names smith added particularly hispanic members from the houston area were interested in a statement of support for uh james henson who directs the texas politics project at the university of texas in austin considers that uh stance falls in line with most of the higher education institutions in the state  while for mark jones chair of the department of political science at rice university the position of universities emphasizes the legislators who are attempting to repeal it are working contrary to the advice of the actual leaders of our most prestigious public universities  for and against state representative ana hernndez uh alumna congratulated the university for its support to the law as a university of houston alumnus im proud to see my alma mater join the university of texas system and stand on the right side of history by supporting continued investment in all texas students educating all students helps provide the wellprepared workforce that our state needs in order to remain competitive hernndez said in a statement in which she also mentioned the university of texas backing of the law ut president william mcraven declared to the texas tribune last week that keeping the law is the right thing to do from a moral point of view and michael young who is in the final stage of negotiations to become the president of texas am university also spoke in favor of the law in an interview with the houston chronicle among those advocating a change in the law is republican representative mark keough representing district 15 covering the woodlands besides keough is one of the lawmakers who submitted one of the bills against the texas dream act to date keoughs proposal has only one cosponsor representative tony tinderholt a republican who represents district 94 which encompasses the city of arlington a suburb of dallas keoughs bill purports that students who currently benefit from the law continue in college but paying outofstate tuition which is more expensive the fact is they are paying a discounted rate which is subsidized by the taxpayers of texas said jaon millsaps chief of staff in keoughs office in reference to undocumented immigrants who are currently benefiting from the socalled instate tuition this is a selective class that they are taking for the future of their education and they are being incentivized with an in state rate that is provided to citizens of texas thats not always provided to those students who come here from out of the state who are also citizens of the united states at the end of the day incentivizing one particular class of students where that incentive is not offered to another particular class of students is not fair he added jones from rice university ruled out that at least in the case of ut and texas am these universities are supporting instate tuition because they need the undocumented students money certainly the university of texas and texas am have more students applying that they can accept so if the law was revoked these universities would not be harmed jones said in addition jones does not believe that uh and other universities that support the law are interested in lobbying in austin because they need to obtain a host of other things from the texas legislature in session  jones was referring to measures that lawmakers could take this year that would affect funding formulas they have to balance what they consider to be the best policy with also not antagonizing large sectors of the texas house and senate he said katia carmona vice president of the youth empowerment alliance a youth lead organization at uh that aims to improve the lives of undocumented students said they expect uh support and that when the time comes to fight the legislature they will be there to back us up  we want the university to support its statement and us by going to the capital to put pressure on legislators she concluded

                          Latinos' political power hasn't matched growth         	2007-08-19	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://www.chron.com//news/houston-texas/article/Latinos-political-power-hasn-t-matched-growth-1614228.php	en	the chant echoed across the country in spring 2006 as hundreds of thousands of latinos marched and rallied for immigrant rights today we march tomorrow we vote it was a powerful sign to legislators of the yetuntapped potential of an emerging hispanic voting bloc latinos heralded the moment as a political reawakening since then grassroots and national latino organizations have placed a large stake in citizenship campaigns and voter registration drives as a way to influence policy but theres been little organized push by latino groups or leaders to capitalize on the momentum to get more latinos elected to public office or pursuing offices beyond the local level that goal locally has drawn new focus with this months census report that latinos are now the largest ethnic or racial group in harris county at 382 percent or 148 million yet theres a void of latino political leadership here at the highest levels nationally there are a handful of elected latino leaders serving in congress but none from the houston area houston also has never had a hispanic mayor and has just three hispanics on the 14member city council the demographic growth doesnt automatically translate into political power said nestor rodriguez chairman of the university of houstons sociology department and codirector for the center for immigration research but with immigration as the impetus latino politics in the us is reassessing and redefining itself latino leadership has long been decentralized by differences in region generation country of origin and ethnicity that decentralization stymies a unified front and vision for hispanics observers said immigration has bound different groups including nonimmigrants who were offended by the racial overtones of some of the antiillegal immigrant rhetoric the youth who were instrumental in leading the school walkouts marches and rallies see their charge as building social movements to influence as a group rather than running for political office said longtime houston immigrants rights activist maria jimenez the key to filling the political power void will be to invest in leadership development said jorge mursuli national executive director of the floridabased democracia usa and vice president of people for the american way latinos dont have a lot of national leaders elected or otherwise so whenever theres an issue finding someone to articulate our messages is not an easy thing mursuli said having national leaders is a sign that weve arrived on the national landscape and that is as important as having local leaders  in harris county the number of elected hispanic political leaders has not kept pace with latino population growth said harris county treasurer orlando sanchez in 2002 sylvia garcia became the first woman and first hispanic elected as one of the four harris county commissioners there is one hispanic state senator in the county and four hispanic state representatives out of 25 who represent harris or parts of it there has never been a hispanic elected to the us house from the houston area although the 29th district was created with that aim in july state representative rick noriega announced that he would be seeking the democratic nomination for us senate to challenge republican incumbent senator john cornyn nationally there are now 5129 latino elected officials a 37 percent increase over the past decade although less than 5 percent of those are at the state and federal level according to the national association of latino elected and appointed officials naleo orlando sanchez a cubanamerican republican was a twotime mayoral runoff candidate who tried to become houstons first hispanic mayor he said having latino candidates run for mayor piques the communitys interest in politics representative ana hernandez dhouston said the cost of running a campaign coupled with the low pay for legislators deter some hispanics from running senators and representatives in texas earn 7200 per year hernandez 28 took a fourmonth leave from her job as an attorney to campaign garcia said the lack of candidates is not because latino politicians arent motivated to run but that theyre waiting for the right opportunity the reality of politics is that incumbency has a lot of power and that is difficult to overcome garcia said and because of low hispanic voter turnout many candidates cannot count on winning with just those votes garcia said of the 44 million latinos in the country nearly 27 million or 60 percent are not eligible to vote because they are too young or they are not citizens a naleo study of harris county voting in 2004 found that although hispanics made up onethird of the countys population they accounted for only 17 percent of registered voters but nationally in the 2006 elections voter turnout among hispanics went up compared to the midterm election in 2002 according to a pew hispanic center analysis changes in houstons latino demographic may also affect future leadership the latino political power in houston is mostly mexicanamerican democrat and concentrated in east houston by contrast some of the most vocal latino leaders during the immigration rallies came from central american groups in southwest houston latinos and particularly youth may have their shortterm focus on strengthening their power of influence observers said it will be at least a few more election cycles before more latinos start to seek higher office particularly positions at the federal level for now many latino youth are getting involved in workers unions which have been revived in recent years primarily because of immigrants said tatcho mindiola director of the university of houston center for mexican american studies others said they see more young latinos working as aides and staffers for elected officials  a potential pipeline for political candidacy we have a representative government a growing number of hispanics should definitely influence politics said alberto de la torre a 21yearold political science major at st edwards university who worked for state representative michael villarreal of san antonio during this springs legislative session de la torre said health care education and immigration top his list in importance james rodriguez the former chief of staff for city councilwoman carol alvarado is now vying to succeed alvarado he said the immigration rallies were an awakening for youth instead of urging youth to run for office the 31yearold university of houston graduate urges them to finish high school and go to college the increase in political representation of latinos is inevitable and vital mursuli said no one can represent you like your own folks he said cynthiagarzachroncom

                          Race may crown Houston's 1st political patrona         	2007-02-12	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://www.chron.com//news/houston-texas/article/Race-may-crown-Houston-s-1st-political-patrona-1555777.php	en	nine months before the city election houston councilwoman carol alvarado and harris county commissioner sylvia garcia are locked in political battle though both deny it and neither will be on the ballot the surface issue is who will succeed the termlimited alvarado representing council district i on the east end the campaigns of james rodriguez alvarados choice and john marron backed by garcia already are busily at work issuing dueling press releases and endorsement lists that typically emerge much later in the political season that is because behindthescenes and with higher stakes the outcome could determine whether one of the women emerges from the fight as the areas first political patrona the woman to know if you aspire to elective office especially in hispanic areas on sylvias part theres always been an element of competitiveness now she just wants to control the politics out in the east end everybodys freaked out by it says longtime political consultant marc campos shes looking to consolidate political power i cant fault her for that  campos admits a bias hes running the campaign of rodriguez who once worked for him alvarado also is a longtime campos client and their friendship dates to when she was a young activist and precinct judge moreover rodriguez was alvarados chief of staff for more than four years and alvarado has an interest in seeing her projects and influence continue whatever her political future it would be advantageous to have an ally on the council term limits put candidates at a disadvantage because it takes two years just to learn your way around city hall in district i we cant afford a twoyear learning curve alvarado says james will hit the ground running he has a good relationship with the mayor and other council members he will not need orientation hell be able to move into the office and continue the progress that i started in district i  sylvia has a right to support who she wants and so do i i just think i have a little more insight into what the needs are in my district  garcia maintains that she is just helping a friend but like alvarado she could gain a loyalist on the council if her candidate wins her highprofile involvement so far includes a letter endorsing marron soon after alvarado wrote one for rodriguez john comes from a family well known in the east end and his family has a long tradition of service marron has the experience and knowledge of the district to serve us well on city council he came and asked me for support said garcia who represents commissioner precinct 2 in east harris county when multiple candidates run for the same seat garcia said it spurs hispanic voters to the ballot box the more hispanics who run the more of us will get elected said garcia who wants to see more people engaged in the political process we have too many occasional voters we need more consistent voters  district i created after a lawsuit forced the council to create singlemember districts mark ed the entry of the hispanic community into elective political power in houston the district has had only three representatives alvarado john castillo and the citys original political patron ben t reyes who later served almost a decade in federal prison on a bribery conviction reyes was elected in 1979 and for a long time was the only hispanic on the council and wielded considerable power his powerbrokering exploits are legendary but times have changed and the district is no longer as docile or monochromatic as it was republican orlando sanchez was elected to a citywide council seat despite strong opposition from the democratic hispanic machine whose grip on hispanic votes even then was loosening he also almost became the first hispanic mayor facing the same opposition former councilman gabriel vasquez similarly and successfully bucked the machine even before voterenacted term limits forced reyes out in 1996 after eight terms his control was unraveling candidates were running and winning without kissing his ring the hispanic political landscape today has changed profoundly becoming diverse unwieldy and probably impossible for any kingmaker to consolidate democratic political consultant dan mcclung who is garcias consultant but is staying neutral in this race likens it to the evolution of black politics in the area when there was only one major leader everybody went to mickey leland mcclung said referring to the congressman who died in a 1989 plane crash as new leaders came along they developed their own turf visibility and profile mcclung said the power is being dispersed and thats a natural occurrence  though marron and rodriguez can put their backers influence to work at some point they will have to start knocking on doors and connecting with voters mcclung said both candidates say they already are rodriguez 31 says he is honored to have alvarados endorsement as her city hall pointman he says he gained an intimate knowledge of the workings of city government and now wants to put it to use i grew up around politics a lot my grandmother on my fathers side was a volunteer at el centro senior center my greatuncles were always involved in political campaigns says rodriguez a lifelong resident of the district ive always had the highest admiration for public servants and always believed in public service  rodriguez grew up in magnolia attended milby high school and graduated from the university of houston marron also was born and raised in the district his father tony marron was a political and civic activist who cut a television commercial for mayor bob lanier during his first race latino votes tipped the scales toward lanier in his defeat of thenmayor kathy whitmire and state representative sylvester turner marron 52 retired three years ago after 30 years with att he is active in the communications workers of america and is an aflcio delegate the latter already has endorsed him for nearly two years he has been a legislative aide for state representative alma allen dhouston marron is steeped in the labor culture and says he wasnt drafted by garcia my dad was always the person that people came to when they wanted to run i know most of the city council the mayor and elected officials in austin and washington dc marron says i started talking about running right after carol got elected last year shes a great lady shes always been our laborendorsed candidate and i campaigned for her but its an open seat and i have the time now to dedicate fully to the community  mcclung calls the race politics at its best but it easily could become politics at its fractious and divisive worst understandably some are wary of wading in and antagonizing alvarado or garcia these things get a little tricky im letting it play out as long as i can mcclung says several other notables also are sitting it out including democratic state sens mario gallegos and john whitmire among the more daring state representatives garnet coleman jessica farrar ana hernandez and dora olivo

dhouston state representativeelect borris miles dhouston and state sens mario gallegos dhouston and rodney ellis dhouston say they are ready to work we could possibly go to a needsbased system as opposed to a lottery system talton said the lottery system has caused a concentration of affordable housing apartment complexes in pockets of the state  talton prefiled one bill  house bill 235  in november the bill states that a taxexempt charitable organization that provides lowincome or moderateincome housing may not be exempt from property taxes after jan 1 2008 unless the organization received a property tax exemption in 2007 it is important for us to be truthful in dealing with the dropout rate noriega said it does not matter whether it is 30 40 or 50 percent  all of those are too high if we do not accurately diagnose the problem then we cannot apply remedies to fix it  noriega said he is supportive of measures to maximize the federal contribution to the states childrens health insurance program chip and homeland security issues some legislators have spoken out against a program requirement to reenroll children every six months because it forces many out of the program also the fewer children enrolled in the program the lower the federal governments monetary match for the program allen prefiled four bills in december two of the four affect public schools house bill 379 proposed to abolish corporal punishment in texas public schools allen said houston schools do not allow corporal punishment but there are pockets of public schools across the state that allow that practice we want our schools to be positive safe places allen said house bill 215 amends the education code to require that each female pupil enrolling in sixth grade be fully immunized against the human papilloma virus or hpv the education code already provides for diphtheria rubeola rubella mumps tetanus and poliomyelitis immunizations individuals charged with an offense related to

largely responsible for the estimated 37000 children in harris county who have been taken off the chip rolls since september 2003 ellis said ellis supports 12 months continuous eligibility for chip participants the legislature must ensure quality monitoring of the new eligibility system so children are not needlessly denied access to the health care they need and deserve ellis said he said he

                          Fireworks, affordable housing on lawmakers' to-do lists         	2007-01-04	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://www.chron.com//neighborhood/pasadena-news/article/Fireworks-affordable-housing-on-lawmakers-to-do-1835083.php	en	from fireworks to affordable housing east harris countys state legislators are busy with bills they hope will become law its part of the hubbub heralding the texas legislatures 80th session which opens tuesday in austin typically the legislature meets once every two years but multiple special sessions in recent years have made it an annual event since 2003 filing bills for the 80th legislature began nov 13 and hundreds are already on paper most will never become law because only a small percentage of those filed each session win passage once the session starts representative wayne smith rbaytown said he will introduce a bill that would make some changes in the state law regulating the use and sale of fireworks fireworks are illegal inside the city limits of houston baytown pasadena and many other area cities but they are allowed with some restrictions in unincorporated harris county smith who was first elected to house district 128 in 2002 said the proposed legislation would lessen the penalty for some types of fireworks violations changing them from class b to class c misdemeanors i think it would help law enforcement he said it would be allowing officers to write tickets rather than make arrests  the bill would also outlaw rocket fireworks or those with sticks or fins smith said legislators have been working on fireworks legislation for 12 to 15 years without substantial progress an aide to smith said smiths bill would seek to find a middle ground between the fireworks industry and proponents of tighter regulations the aide said in a different vein smith said he is considering legislation that would require parents to attend teacherparent conferences if the bill became a law parents who failed to show up could be fined just as parents can now be held responsible for their childrens truancy from school he said representative robert talton rpasadena has filed hb 235 which he says would make it easier for owners of lowrent apartment buildings to make money and thus would encourage people to get into the business of affordable housing talton who has represented house district 144 since 1992 also said he plans to reintroduce a different affordablehousing bill which he had filed during the 79th session that bill hb 1167 died in 2005 on the floor of the house of representatives on a point of order two items from the 79th session that talton said he doesnt anticipate reintroducing in 2007 concern texas chiropractic college in pasadena and gay foster parents in 2005 he introduced hb 2768 which would have made the chiropractic college part of the university of houston system that bill died in committee without coming before the house talton said he would love to see an arrangement between the two schools obviously that would help the pasadena area he said im always looking for something like that  of much higher profile last session was taltons proposal to ban gay people from serving as foster parents he introduced it in 2005 as an amendment to senate bill 6 which addressed reforming the department of family and protective services the amendment passed the house but a conference committee of senate and house members removed it before the bills final version was approved in 2003 talton had introduced the ban as a separate bill which died in committee talton said he had no intention of proposing such a bill this session and was not aware of any other anticipated bill to which he could offer an amendment to ban gay foster parents senator mario gallegos a democrat whose senate district 6 includes towns along the houston ship channel has already introduced two bills one that would require monitoring and controlling emissions of air contaminants and one that would prevent sex offenders from living within 1500 feet of each other i would at least try to have them not work against it said gallegos who was first elected to the senate in 1994 hopefully we can work something out because those folks hire my constituents  gallegos said he anticipated taking some bills to the legislature on behalf of the port of houston authority but he didnt know the details yet he also said he planned to confer with local community college officials about construction needs that could be paid for with tuition revenue bonds such bonds must be approved by the legislature representative ana hernandez dhouston won a special election runoff in december 2005 to finish the term of the late representative joe moreno who was killed in may of that year in an automobile accident hernandez who represents house district 143 said she wants to work on companion legislation to gallegos air quality bill which had been one of morenos priorities a lot of our focus will be on that bill said hernandez a former aide to moreno and state representative jessica farrar its an important issue and

                          Robison: Perry wants more line items to veto         	2006-12-18	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://www.chron.com//opinion/article/Robison-Perry-wants-more-line-items-to-veto-1538358.php	en	austin  money is power and in few situations is that more evident than in the states budgetsetting process which is controlled by the legislature not the governor besides making recommendations which often are ignored by lawmakers a governors main influence over texas spending priorities is his lineitem veto his ability to strike specific items from the budgets drafted by the legislature this is a power that even the president of the united states doesnt have and governor rick perry has avidly exercised it he has vetoed more than 2 billion from state budgets since becoming governor six years ago but with the twoyear budget growing from 98 billion to 138 billion during his administration he is eager to redline even more particularly from higher education which has been largely protected from his veto pen even though much of the budgetary growth has been driven by enrollment increases in the public schools and higher medicaid caseloads factors over which the governor and legislators have little control perrys vetoes are a mere drop in the bucket by hardline conservative republican standards increasing his veto opportunities will be a key part of the greater accountability and budgetary transparency that perry will be promoting for higher education after lawmakers convene in january perry wants the legislature to provide more detail in university budgets which at present are mostly written in lump sums  one spending total for an entire campus  from which the governor cannot delete specific programs or expenditures that he may find objectionable in other words the lineitem veto isnt very powerful when there arent many line items to veto this appropriations pattern dates back to 1987 when the democrats who were still in charge of the legislature used it to keep republican governor bill clements from slashing his way through the higher education budget hiding wasteful expenditures behind worthwhile expenditures is a budgetary sham that makes government more bloated less accountable and less transparent perry has said republicans of course run the legislature now but so far they havent been in a hurry to return any budgetary prerogatives to the governor and university officials arent eager to see the governor given more oversight of their appropriations republican budgetwriters and university presidents also disagree with the governor that the higher education budget contains much waste just ask one of them but senate education chairman florence shapiro rplano who also serves on the senate finance committee said perry may have some support while more budget details would increase the governors veto power it also would help lawmakers more fully understand where those dollars are spent she said spokesman robert black said perry will offer a number of other higher education initiatives maybe even incentive funding for universities or an exit test for some university graduates as a means of measuring the quality of their educations details will come later he said black said perry also will support efforts to repeal or restrict the top 10 percent law which guarantees the highest ranked high school graduates admission to the state university of their choice but is excluding thousands of other qualified students from the university of texas at austin he said perry still likes the tuition deregulation law despite student and parent unhappiness over recent huge jumps in tuition charges perry signed that law in 2003 when the legislature cut university appropriations to help bridge a revenue shortfall without higher state taxes the idea is to make a lower appraisal cap more palatable to counties cities and the legislators they influence by offering a new funding source to replace the property tax revenue that would be lost to lower appraisals harris county commissioners court is on record for a lower appraisal cap but paukens proposal still has strong opposition from the texas association of counties and other local officials legislative prospects would seem iffy because constitutional amendments require a twothirds vote in both the house and the senate a lower appraisal cap without the sales tax attached failed to get a majority vote much less twothirds in the house in 2005 the sales tax proposal coming on the heels of a new controversial business tax which lawmakers enacted last spring may simply add more baggage said elna christopher a spokeswoman for the counties group paukens task force also is looking at a revenue cap which would make it easier for voters to roll back local tax increases that measure would simply require a majority legislative vote about 35 young people will be working in legislative offices throughout the capitol mostly in the house said ellis staffer kenneth besserman ellis raises private contributions to finance the program which he has been sponsoring for years one notable alumna is representative ana hernandez dhouston representative mark strama daustin is a former ellis staffer although he never participated in the

other houston students earlier this week to protest pending federal legislation that could put friends and family members at risk of deportation but after an hourlong talk with leaders of her eastside houston charter school mares decided her best course of action would be to read the bills and to write lawmakers were old enough to think about it the alternative learning  transition academy student said instead of walking out and making our school look bad we wrote letters  their letterwriting campaign grabbed the attention of us representative gene green and state representative ana hernandez both houston democrats who spent about an hour at the school friday talking to students about the legislative process and their views on the controversial bills green said he voted against the house resolution that would have made it a felony to be an illegal immigrant and would have built fences along the border thats not what americas about he said we all came from somewhere  after nearly a week of protests some students are searching for more sophisticated less disruptive ways of getting their message across students seem to be heeding warnings to cut out the walkouts that resulted in at least 26 arrests dozens of suspensions and countless other disciplinary actions theyre organizing debates lobbying legislators and scheduling informational meetings after school on weekends and even during lunch we decided to work with the school and the school decided to work with us alta student dulce garcia 21 said any kind of current event the students are interested in is a chance to teach kids thinking and reasoning skills said tony wagner codirector of the change leadership group at the harvard graduate school of education we do much too little thinking in schools any opportunity we have that we dont take advantage of is a missed opportunity  with such a groundswell of interest among houston teens educators should find ways to incorporate activities about immigration into art history english spanish government and economics experts said here is one of those opportunities to bring the classroom out and to bring the world in said barbara cervone president of what kids can do a rhode islandbased nonprofit group it seems like one of those teachable moments and i think schools can structure it in such a way that its not a tinderbox for them  unfortunately she said schools are often overly cautious about addressing tough issues some teachers and administrators dont feel equipped to handle the debate its been in the nature of schools to shy away from the very things that teenagers want to talk about most she said and kids dont bring a lot of information to the table we have a lot of attitudes about immigration issues but we dont have a lot of information about it  rachel houston 14 a ninthgrader in pearland wishes teachers at her school would have helped her understand the house bill and how to best protest before she joined a rally on campus tuesday that landed her with a citation a threeday suspension and a week at an alternative campus i had a feeling they knew what was going to happen they just didnt want to bring it up she said no ones going to listen to 14 15 and 16yearold children  at alta teachers in every class started talking about the immigration debate tuesday and administrators even agreed to bus students to greens office to handdeliver their letters still administrator jose hernandez said he was surprised that his students had the willpower to resist when students from neighboring milby and chavez high schools chanted outside during a walkout on wednesday hes also surprised by how much the students have absorbed this week when this started they werent talking about house resolution 4437 he said they were saying i dont want my parents taken away  tatcho mindiola director of the center for mexican american studies at the university of houston said some adults dont understand how emotional this issue is to young hispanics there have been some students in hisd who were born here of undocumented parents who have been crying who are very stressed out of fear that their parents will be deported those are very real issues he said the fear and the debate have made it hard for some students to focus on other subjects weve read the bill weve talked to people we have a petition said alejandra castro 17 a sophomore at reagan high school and one of about 70 students who were to participate in a rally after class friday right now immediately the best way you can respond is by your success noriega said ace the taks test he said referring to the texas assessment of knowledge and skills noriega also helped educate students about possible legislative solutions to the 12 million undocumented immigrants estimated to be living in the country and how students can influence solutions principal bertie simmons organized the event i hope they learn what it means to live in a country where they can voice their opinions and the appropriate way to voice them she said chronicle reporter dale lezon contributed to this report jenniferradcliffechroncom

of houston after oil coffee is the secondmost traded commodity in the world and if you look at houston and texas were right in the middle of the country its the ideal location for our business says carmen de aldecoa public relations director for the familyowned cadeco de aldecoa her brother carlos de aldecoa bueno and their four sisters are the third generation of a family of spanish coffeemakers who first roasted their beans over coal in the 1920s in the 1940s they moved their business to veracruz mexico and in the early 1980s they moved their plant to houstons clinton drive off lockwood along with their parents the family is cadecos management team my father saw an opportunity here and it has worked very well for us we all found our niche within the business and within the

exempt stored coffee and cocoa beans from inventory taxes at the end of each year green coffee stores up to three years it does not deteriorate and can be kept until the price is right for trading the stocks says macnab its a matter of money  in 2001 the late state representative joe moreno and state senator mario gallegos cosponsored legislation to exempt all green coffee and raw cocoa imports stored in harris county from the taxes voters approved the constitutional amendment that november it was a great piece of legislation that brought lots of jobs to the east end and of course attracted

and the only one west of the mississippi river weve been receiving coffee shipments through the port of houston since forever and the fact that houston is now a green coffee port is going to continue to help us says greg scott interim plant manager for sara lee foodservice here port officials predict the tax relief and subsequent designation could double the amount of coffee entering the port

schofield republican lawyer mike schofield 50 handled legislative matters for rick perry for six sessions which gives him an understanding of the lawmaking process that democrat luis lopez does not have lopez 25 has a compelling story he came from mexico as a child and has gone on to become a citizen accountant and business owner but schofield can more immediately help the far west houston district that includes katy and the cyfair area deal with the explosive growth expected there so we endorse him district 133 jim murphy  republican incumbent jim murphy 56 whose district runs from loop 610 west through the villages out to highway 6 has supported some good issues for houston and can work with democrats to get things done he passed a bill in the last legislative session enabling houston to build hikeandbike trails along centerpoint energy rightsofway and coordinated with democratic state senator rodney ellis to make it happen he also was the only legislator who tried albeit unsuccessfully to rein in the financially onerous houston firefighters pension plan we liked democrat laura nicol 51 who has been active in her homeowners association but murphy has done some heavy lifting for houston and gets our endorsement district 134 sarah davis  if you want a simple summary of state representative sarah davis here it is shes a texas republican who has been supported by equality texas and planned parenthood at a time when the republican party of texas seems driven to the extremes davis 38 stands as an example of an independentminded conservative who puts her district ahead of political expediency her wealthy and highly educated constituency which includes west university place memorial park and bellaire demands a wellinformed and nuanced representative who can speak on more than socialwedge issues instead davis keeps the focus on the texas medical center working to address texas nursing shortage and improving medical education funding the democratic opponent alison ruff is barely visible on the campaign trail making this race an easy win for davis district 135 no endorsement as republican incumbent gary elkins tells it his biggest accomplishment during 20 years in the legislature was the elimination of slower speed limits at night his other unfortunate claim to fame was in 2011 when he disgraced the house by defending the payday lending business against state regulation in a massive conflict of interest  he himself owns payday lender businesses elkins 59 told us he will fight against overregulation but couldnt give any specifics he couldnt remember how many bills he filed last session or the details of a key constitutional amendment on the nov 4 ballot yet this hapless spouter of republican clichs keeps getting reelected in the northwest suburban district that includes jersey village and the cyfair area his opponent democrat moiz abbas 60 is a good guy and smart but we havent seen much of a campaign so well make no endorsement district 137 gene wu democratic incumbent gene wu caught on quickly in his first session in austin and became a player in the fight to restore a previously cut 39 billion in education funding he wants to get more money for schools next session while also pursuing energy and criminal justice matters the former harris county prosecutors highly diverse westside district includes gulfton and sharpstown wu 36 can be dismissive of those not as sharp and intense as he is but hes a comer and gets our endorsement republican challenger morad h fiki 35 wants to clean up the districts crime but his plan to bring in more law enforcement may be better dealt with by the city district 138 dwayne bohac republican incumbent dwayne bohac 48 cosponsored fellow state representative jim murphys successful bill to create hikeandbike trails on centerpoint energy rightsofway he wants to lower the property tax appraisal cap from its current 10 percent a year to five percent and wind down the margins tax on business profits and he has some interesting ideas for reforming public education including getting more parental collaboration triangleshaped district 138 goes from loop 610 northwest to little york road and includes the energy corridor on interstate 10 democratic opponent fred r vernon has kept such a low profile we know little about him we endorse bohac district 144 mary ann perez in her first legislative session democrat mary ann perez former chairwoman of the houston community college board of trustees emerged as a strong advocate for education both in terms of getting more money for it and proposing such things as allowing junior colleges to offer bachelors degrees she wants schoolbusiness partnerships to train her constituents for skilled jobs in heavily industrialized district 144 which includes pasadena the houston ship channel and baytown perez 52 is a dependable voice for womens issues including reasonable access to abortion which her republican opponent perennial candidate gilbert pena 65 opposes pena also opposes houstons proposed equal rights ordinance district 144 is majority hispanic and leans democratic but republicans see it as winnable we endorse perez for reelection district 148 jessica cristinafarrar first elected 20 years ago at the age of 27 state representative jessica cristina farrar has spent her time in austin as a passionate and unrepentant advocate for womens health and childhood education issues her courageous advocacy and strength of her convictions should earn her another term representing this north houston district which covers spring branch east the greater heights near northside and northline now at 47 farrar has gained seniority and knows how to make austin work for her district republican challenger chris carmona 32 is eloquent on the issues but cannot bridge the gap to solutions meeting with the chronicle he spoke about the need to get nonprofits and churches involved with the community but his main proposal involved altering federal tax policy that prohibits nonprofits from engaging in partisan politicking if this unique idea is carmonas goal he should be running for congress not state legislature district 150 amy perez incumbent debbie riddle 65 is seeking a seventh term in the house where she is a dependable conservative vote with a bad habit of sticking her foot in her mouth she is best known for her absurd  and telling  rant that free education comes from moscow from russia it comes straight out of the pit of hell  she also flamed out on cnn claiming terror babies were being born in the us in contrast democrat amy perez is a history teacher in a local district and dedicated to public education and fully knows its problems once she won teacher of the year in a local district then got laid off because funds for social studies ran out perez 29 has no political experience but is super smart and might teach the legislature something about education in the district that goes from the woodlands south to fm 1960 and includes spring its time for a change we endorse amy perez the following races are uncontested or have only thirdparty opponents district 126 patricia harless district 127 dan huberty district 128 wayne smith district 130 allen fletcher district 131 alma a allen district 139 sylvester turner district 140 armando lucio

                          School board elections a report card for Grier         	2011-10-15	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://www.chron.com//news/houston-texas/article/School-board-elections-a-report-card-for-Grier-2220811.php	en	hes not on the ballot but houston isd superintendent terry grier is a key figure in next months school board elections grier has led the states largest school district for two years  winning fervent fans and foes  and the newly elected trustees will have to decide whether to extend his tenure or cut it short voters will be taking a strong look at the programs and the state of the district when they make their decision said zeph capo an officer with the houston federation of teachers union whether thats good or bad for grier well see after november 8th  four of the nine school board seats are up for election and the fate of the incumbents could determine griers future his contract runs through 2012 and automatically extends another year unless the board gives him notice by dec 1 2012 that it wants to sever ties only one of the seven candidates davetta daniels has said publicly that she would vote against extending the contract the incumbents up for reelection and the other challengers did not give a definitive answer on a houston chronicle questionnaire daniels a retired principal in the houston independent school district is challenging board president paula harris for the district iv seat if the decision were made today it would be no problem for me to end the contract daniels said the morale of hisd has been extremely low there is a lack of trust among parent groups and teacher groups with the superintendents leadership teachers are nestled in a climate of intimidation and fear  procurement questions harris director of community affairs for the oil fieldservices company schlumberger generally has supported grier voting to expand his signature reform program apollo to elementary schools and pushing to include student test scores in teachers job evaluations harris close friendships with several hisd contractors including the attorney the board used to negotiate griers contract have raised questions recently about whether the districts procurement practices are free from undue influence harris who defeated daniels in a race for the seat four years ago has raised more money and has been endorsed by the harris county aflcio and the houston businesseducation coalition the houston federation of teachers did not endorse in the race this is a pivotal election for the future of the district said jonathan day chairman of the business coalition our view is that the district is fundamentally headed in the right direction  grier too has garnered support from the business community with the greater houston partnership passing a resolution this month praising his innovative and effective leadership  the district iii race pits incumbent manuel rodriguez jr against ramiro fonseca who lost to rodriguez eight years ago several elected officials  including mayor annise parker and state representatives carol alvarado jessica farrar ana hernandez luna and garnet coleman and state senator mario gallegos  are backing fonseca gallegos was one of the first and loudest critics of grier the harris county aflcio and the teachers union also endorsed fonseca who works with houston community colleges minority male initiative and previously managed student loan centers rodriguez is a smallbusiness owner and longtime parent volunteer just like we hold our teachers and principals accountable we also need to hold the superintendent accountable fonseca said if we have seen little improvement when it is time to extend superintendent griers contract the board will have to make a very hard decision based upon what is in the best interest for the students  rodriguez said it would be unfair to say whether he would extend griers contract until the superintendents job evaluation is completed rodriguez has sided with the board majority in supporting the apollo program and overhauling the teacher appraisal system in district viii incumbent juliet stipeche has raised nearly six times as much money as her opponent dorothy olmos who lost to stipeche in a special election last year the houston businesseducation coalition the harris county aflcio and teachers union are backing stipeche an attorney stipeche said her decision on grier would be based on the districts overall academic progress and the culture that has evolved under his leadership  grier on sidelines olmos a smallbusiness owner said its too soon to judge griers performance but that she would rate how well he executed the boards strategic plan rhonda skillernjones a parent who serves on several hisd committees will replace carol mims galloway who did not seek reelection skillernjones is a member of hisd parent visionaries a parent group that has been critical of grier three of the five board members who arent up for reelection this november served when grier was hired in 2009 i dont get involved in board elections said grier noting that hisd has seen improvements including a higher graduation rate under his watch were doing a lot of good work but weve got work left to do  erickamellonchroncom

                          Final filings: We have a statewide Democrat         	2013-12-10	HOUSTON CHRONICLE	http://blog.chron.com/kuffsworld/2013/12/final-filings-we-have-a-statewide-democrat/	en	boy i didnt see this coming judge larry meyers longtime texas court of criminal appeals judge lawrence larry meyers announced monday that he is leaving the republican party to run as a democrat for the texas supreme court meyers of fort worth filed monday on the last day of filing to seek place 6 on the supreme court currently held by jeff brown i am thrilled to welcome judge meyers to the texas democratic party texas democratic party chairman gilberto hinojosa said i am even more excited to know that judge meyers doesnt stand alone every day i hear from real voters that our party represents the strongest path forward for our state texas is changing and voters will continue ot reject a republican party more focused on ideology than ideas  meyers party switch makes him the first statewide democratic officeholder since 1998 whats more since his term on the cca isnt up until 2016 no matter what happens in that race hell be on the bench at least until then its a little strange having a criminal court judge running for a civil court but thats far from the strangest thing thats happened this cycle meyers announced a challenge to sharon keller in the gop primary in 2012 despite having previously been an ally of hers but as far as i can tell he didnt actually go through with it the sos page for the 2012 gop primary shows her as unopposed in any event welcome to the party judge meyers best of luck in your election that was the first surprise of the day but it wasnt the last and may not have been the biggest for next came this us representative steve stockman rfriendswood has filed to run against us senator john cornyn in the march gop primary joining at least eight other hopefuls vying for the senior senators seat according to a spokesman with the republican party of texas stockman who had filed for reelection in congressional district 36 had to withdraw from that race to seek cornyns seat in an interview with the website wnd stockman said he was running because he was extremely disappointed in the way cornyn treated his fellow congressmen and broke the 11th commandment and undermined ted cruzs fight to stop obamacare  theres crazy theres bat crazy and then theres steve stockman who does a triple lutz barrel roll with a halfgainer but still sticks the landing take that louie gohmert gop political consultant matt mackowiak said stockman faces an uphill battle from recent investigations into his political and fundraising operation to cornyns huge bankroll  now we will find out if senator cornyn is truly vulnerable which i have doubted mackowiak said adding i predict that not one member of the congressional delegation will support stockman ultimately he will need outside groups to spend and that is the most important unknown right now  all i can say is that so far no one has gone broke underestimating the insanity of republican primary voters i suppose theres a first time for everything in the meantime i join with pdiddie texpatriate juanita and bor in marveling at the spectacle stockmans change in office means that he wont be running for cd36 which means theres at least a chance congress could be a tiny bit less wacko in 2015 there are three other republicans running and one democrat meanwhile michael cole has had his eye on the heavilyrepublican district since 2012 when he ran as a libertarian he got about 6000 votes in that election now cole a 38 year old teacher from orange texas is running again as a democrat he says he has a campaign team in place has been crisscrossing the district and is about to file his first report on fundraising to the federal elections commission he said hed focus on getting things done and charged outgoing stockman with wasting time on politics i can listen to what my constituents want instead of just showboating against barack obama he said noting that his major focus would be on middle class job growth the change in candidates doesnt change the fact that this is a 70 gop district but still a republican and a libertarian both turning democrat to run next year not a bad day if you ask me anyway heres the tdp list which will not include people that filed at their county offices and the harris county gop list ive put the hcdp list beneath the fold since the updated version of it isnt online just yet stace notes the contested primaries of interest in harris county but here are a few other highlights  in addition to larry meyers the dems have two other supreme court candidates bill moody and gina benavides who is a justice on the 13th court of appeals and one cca candidate john granberg for place 3 not a full slate but not too bad according to a tdp press release granberg is an attorney from el paso as is moody who is a district court judge and benavides is from mcallen  kinky friedman has a second opponent for ag commissioner hugh asa fitzsimons iii either the dems got used to the idea of friedman on the ballot or they failed utterly to find an opponent for him that isnt some dude i never thought id say this but as things stand today id vote for kinky  another press release from the tdp makes a nicesounding claim  today the texas democratic party announced its slate of candidates for 2014 texas democrats are fielding more candidates for statewide office in this election cycle than any time since 2002 in addition to the statewide slate the party devoted significant time to recruiting for down ballot races and announced challengers in state senate districts 10 and 17 and a full slate of candidates to the state board of education the party spent significant time recruiting justices of the peace county constables county judges county commissioners and others in places like lubbock wichita falls san angelo and across texas i like the look of that i wish they had more information in that release but its an encouraging sign regardless  there will not be a rematch in cd33 between representative marc veasey and domingo garcia as a fan of representative veasey im glad to hear that  representative harold dutton did file for reelection in hd142 some people just cant be rushed i guess representative carol alvarado joined representative alma allen in drawing a primary challenger as susan delgado filed at the last minute in hd145 ill be voting for representative alvarado thanks oh and the gop did find a challenger for hd144  gilbert pena who lost in the primary for that district in 2012  dems did not get candidates foe each local judicial race but there are a few contested judicial primaries yes thats a little frustrating but people will run where they want to run  no one is running against commissioner jack morman and no one else is running for county judge alas ann harris bennett has an opponent for county clerk gayle mitchell who filed a finance report in july but has been quiet since  possibly the biggest surprise locally is that outgoing cm melissa noriega filed for hcde at large position 7 making that a three way race with traci jensen and lily leal i will have more on that later im sure ill have plenty more to say about many of these races soon heres the chron story for now which doesnt add anything i

CHRONICLE	http://www.chron.com//news/politics/article/Miles-reflects-new-generation-of-black-officials-1886635.php	en	borris miles is hardly a household name in houston but hes a savvy businessman and political operative who beat veteran lawmaker al edwards by energetically exploiting his political weak spots miles 40 represents a new generation of black democratic elected officials in houston he first considered challenging edwards four years ago last june miles drove to austin to meet with the legislator but ended up waiting in his office for hours edwards refused to meet with him miles said and that was when he decided to run he asked if i could stand down and give him one more term miles said of a later conversation with edwards but i had to do it it was just my time  although he faces a libertarian opponent in the nov 7 general election miles is the strong favorite to assume the district 146 seat next january first on his list for the district which includes the third ward and sunnyside is setting up a functional district office instead of one he said edwards maintains with an answering machine miles admits he can be ostentatious sporting custommade suits and gucci shoes he threw his 40th birthday party at the rice lofts last year where the theme was fantastic voyage and the group lakeside performed its classic song but he also used that charm on the campaign trail gaining votes by serving people breakfast in an apron at community forums edwards first elected in 1978 is best known for making juneteenth a state holiday al edwards style and work was fine for another era said state representative garnet coleman who has had differences with edwards for several years and supported miles and at that time he had the interest and needs of folks in poor conditions at the end he was voting republican house speaker tom craddicks interests and thats the disconnect he betrayed whatever principles he had previously in protecting peoples civil rights  that edwards drew two credible challengers was a sign that he was in trouble coleman said lawyer al bennett placed third in the march democratic primary in a district where roots are important miles let it be known that he was homegrown he grew up in sunnyside and is a lifelong resident of the district miles attended yates high school and graduated from the houston high school for law enforcement then earned a degree in criminal justice from sam houston state university in 1996 miles started his oneman insurance agency operation in his garage apartment he has since purchased and renovated two city blocks on almeda where he leases space to seven other businesses miles has been laying the groundwork for this run for years he has been active in several civic organizations among them the urban league united negro college fund and 100 black men of houston and hes been active in the politics for the past two decades contributing on both sides of the aisle miles gave democratic state representative sylvester turner several thousand in his 2003 mayoral campaign he donated 2500 to republican governor rick perry in 2004 and 2100 to republican us senator kay bailey hutchison last year miles also drove turner around town during his 1991 mayoral race yet turner backed edwards candidacy edwards had the support of some democratic establishment stalwarts including us representatives al green and sheila jackson lee and the rev william lawson pastor emeritus of wheeler avenue baptist church but lawsons wife audrey and current wheeler avenue pastor marcus cosby backed morris campaign thats how miles garnered support aiming for those who werent obligated to edwards because of past ties and relationships most of houstons democratic state house delegation backed miles candidacy including coleman and state representatives alma allen jessica farrar ana hernandez and rick noriega craig washington a former state representative senator and congressman who represented parts of district 146 in each job but who has kept a low profile since losing his us house seat to jackson lee in 1994 emerged to endorse miles ive stayed out of elections because i returned to being a voter and consider myself a bystander washington said but i felt compelled to get involved in this election when i saw a person who was not articulating and advocating on behalf of the people of the district representative edwards lost the ability to be an effective leader  it wasnt so much that he supported miles but that he opposed edwards washington said i would have supported whoever was in the runoff washington said its time for a fresh voice to put a fresh horse on the track  the people who signed onto his campaign are the political laborers of the community miles said we shared a common agenda they are in the trenches these are the working politicians not the people who sit high and look low they are actively involved miles said coleman says miles is successful because of his work ethic he demonstrated that hes a hard worker coleman said he has a tenacity and vigilance thats needed for the district and on the floor of the house  kristenmackchroncom
Updated: Garcia Wins Houston Senate Race	2013-03-02	Texas Tribune	www.texastribune.org/2013/03/02/sd6-too-close-call/	en	updated saturday 1045 pm  former harris county commissioner sylvia garcia defeated state representative carol alvarado for a seat in the texas senate winning a runoff with 529 percent to alvarados 471 percent the voting in saturdays runoff between the two houston democrats capped an expensive and hardfought special election to replace the late senator mario gallegos dhouston with about 95 percent of precincts reporting garcia had 9562 votes to alvarados 8514 that represents a turnout of about 6 percent the announcement of the results set off thunderous applause at an events hall off i45 where hundreds of garcias supporters had gathered garcia acknowledged the timing of the election could limit what she might have done with a full term the legislature will have two months behind it before she takes office what well do is just work with some of the legislation thats already been filed not only on the senate side bit with some of the house members that i have been working with during this campaign she told the tribune well just have to work with what we got  alvarado tweeted her intentions when the results were clear i go back to austin on monday and i wont skip a beat  garcia said she will make health care and public education her priorities and said she anticipated that the delegation which was split in its support between the two candidates will heal and come together both she and alvarado will be in austin now as members of the same delegation its all about moving forward and moving the ball forward and making sure we get things done not only for this district but for the state of texas she said state representative armando walle dhouston was one of garcias earliest supporters and said saturdays election means the delegation has added a strong and motivated latina to fight for houston the election is over district 145 gets to have a strong leader and advocate he said and it has a strong senator to advocate for our community in tandem  original story houston  about 650 votes separate the two harris county democrats vying to replace the late state senator mario gallegos in houstons senate district 6 earlyvoting tallies released saturday night show state representative carol alvarado dhouston a former houston city councilwoman who is serving her third term in the texas house garnered 4448 votes about 47 percent and sylvia garcia a former harris county commissioner who also served as a city of houston controller earned 5101 or 53 percent of the approximately 9550 votes cast during the early voting period from feb 20 to feb 26 saturdays special election is the result of a jan 26 election in which alvarado and garcia emerged as the top two votegetters from a field of eight candidates in that contest garcia finished with 7416 votes about 454 percent of the ballots cast alvarado received 6803 about 416 percent gallegos the first hispanic senator to represent harris county died oct 16 from complications associated with a 2007 liver transplant the early voting numbers are just reflective of the strong lead we had on jan 26 said terrysa guerra garcias campaign manager this is a good lead but right now its still not over  alvarados camp was also cautious not to read too much in to saturdays first tallies after early voting wed obviously like to be in a better position but were just going to see what happens said marc campos alvarados campaign manager the early voting totals reflect a lackluster turnout of only about 9550 voters in the district voter turnout was also low during januarys contest fewer than 16000  or about 56 percent  cast ballots the eventual winner will have to catch up in a legislative session in full swing the 140day session began jan 8 and will end may 27 the deadline to file legislation is this friday harris county has 10 days to canvass the results
